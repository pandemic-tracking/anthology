    "title": "Variants, Sublineages, and Recombinants: The Constantly Changing Genome of SARS-CoV-2",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When a virus replicates, it makes copies of all of its genes. In the process, it makes mistakes, like typos in the string of 30,000 letters that make up the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Those mistakes may result in changes in the amino acids that make up a protein, altering its structure. Usually, those mistakes, or mutations, make no difference in how the virus functions or may even weaken the virus. Rarely, mutations may make the virus better able to cause disease, spread, or evade immunity. When a population of viruses with the same set of mutations is found in enough hosts, that group is labeled a variant. Going back to the tree analogy, think of variants as distinct branches.\nEvery time SARS-CoV-2 infects a person and replicates, mutations will occur. In the course of two years, there have been an unimaginable number of opportunities for mutations, with over470 million documented infections, and likely many more undocumented infections. As long as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, it will evolve and new variants will emerge. However, most of them will not end up causing global surges and won’t be any more of a threat than existing variants.\nBut what about variants carrying these rare mutations that make them more infectious or deadly? Researchers perform genomic surveillance on the virus to monitor its evolution in an effort to identify variants that may pose a threat. Variants that have the potential or demonstrated ability to be much more transmissible, immune evasive, or virulent are closely monitored and may be designated as variants of interest (VOIs), or variants of concern (VOCs). The World Health Organization has designated five variants as VOCs and given them the Greek letter names Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron.\n\nEach variant of concern is actually a population of related viruses.\nAlthough we talk about “the Delta variant” and “the Omicron variant” as if they were single entities, each is in fact made up of a population of many individual viruses with different patterns of mutations. Some of the mutations are important to the function of the virus. The rest usually don’t amount to much on a functional level, but they can be useful for tracing the transmission of viruses. For example, in an outbreak, the genetic sequences of viruses from infected people can help nail down the origin of the outbreak. It’s a viral version of the genetic tests people use to trace their ancestries, but researchers analyze the 30,000 RNA bases in the viral genome instead of the 3.4 billion DNA bases in the human genome.\n\n\nOrganizing and classifying SARS-CoV-2 viruses has become a huge undertaking.\nWhen researchers sequence samples of SARS-CoV-2, they may submit those sequences to public databases, such as GISAID or GenBank. Careful analysis of these sequences can reveal patterns and trends. Very early in the pandemic, this was a (relatively) simple task. As the pandemic progressed and millions of people became hosts for replicating viruses, the viruses accumulated more and more mutations. The result is a diverse viral population. By June 2020, there were more than 35,000 publicly available sequences, and it became clear that a method to organize and classify these viruses was needed. As of March 23, 2022, there were over 9.6 million sequences submitted to GISAID alone.\nSeveral commonly used naming systems classify the evolving forms of the virus, relying on rules determined by genomics experts to recognize the branches and twigs of the SARS-CoV-2 family tree. The terminology can differ between systems and in media reports, resulting in some confusion.\n\nA clade or lineage is a group of genetically similar viruses with a common ancestor.\nA sublineage is a group of similar viruses within a lineage.\nA subvariant is a sublineage of a variant, usually referring to a variant of concern.\n\nThe most widely used naming systems include Pango and Nextstrain. Although the major lineage and clade assignments correspond in general, systems may group viruses slightly differently, listing different specific mutations as being characteristic of the lineage or clade, for example. Mutations that are known or suspected to affect the variant’s ability to cause disease, spread, or evade immunity are more consistently included. (Unless stated otherwise, Pango lineages will be used here.) The WHO includes all of the sublineages of a lineage within its labels for variants of concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. SARS-CoV-2 Variants designated as Variants of Concern by the WHO are given Greek letter names. Other naming systems use different conventions.\n\n\nAs variants continue to evolve, they may acquire new mutations that have the potential to make them more of a threat. Variant sublineages are derived from variants by acquiring potentially significant additional mutations and these may evolve into genetically distinct forms of a variant that gain a competitive advantage and spread in a population. These subvariants may be monitored separately. The more opportunities a virus has to infect and replicate, the more mutations it will acquire, and the more sublineages it will propagate.\nSome mutations or groups of mutations are known to confer an increased ability to persist and spread, and have arisen independently in distinct lineages. In this convergent evolution, viruses with these traits are better able to multiply, and thus can outcompete lineages that do not have such advantages.\n\n\nAs the Delta variant circulated widely, it produced many subvariants.\nThe Delta variant, which was dominant worldwide between June and December 2021, has over 200 known sublineages. In the summer of 2021, a Delta subvariant, now called AY.1, was detected with an additional mutation that was associated with the ability to evade the immune system. More recently, another sublineage of Delta, called AY.4.2, was detected in at least 42 countries. It had three potentially worrisome mutations and began to increase in prevalence in some areas, although it did not reach very high levels worldwide.\nSublineages of the Delta variant are closely monitored, in part because the “next wave” was expected to arise from the Delta lineage. That expectation proved incorrect.\nWhen the Omicron variant was first sequenced in November 2021, it was found to have an astounding 50 mutations, compared to the original virus sequenced in January 2020. Moreover, genetic analysis revealed that the Omicron lineage had diverged from the other lineages sometime in mid-2020. The origins of such an unusual sequence continue to be a source of much speculation by scientists.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Chart of global SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC) growth from October 4, 2020 to March 21, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe Omicron variant consists of several major sublineages.\nSoon after its discovery, the Omicron variant was shown to have three quite distinct sublineages: BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. They are, in fact, as different from each other, genetically, as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta are from each other. The highly transmissible BA.1 sublineage is the sublineage that spread so explosively worldwide. BA.1 is also known as B.1.1.529.1 or Nextstrain clade 21K. The BA.2 sublineage (also known as B.1.1.529.2 or Nextstrain clade 21L) appears to be even more transmissible than BA.1, which it has largely displaced. Another sublineage, BA.1.1, is derived from BA.1, and possesses an additional mutation (S:R345K) that may help it evade immunity. BA.1.1 has grown in prevalence in some areas. BA.2.2, a sublineage of BA.2 with an unusual spike mutation makes up the majority of Omicron samples in Hong Kong, and has also been detected in several other countries.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary tree diagram using Nextstrain data and adapted from the work of Dr. Emma Hodcroft. The distance between branches and twigs shows the differences in mutations between lineages and sublineages. This tree shows both Pango lineages and Nextstrain clades for Delta and Omicron where applicable.\n\n\n\n\nDiagnostic tests are different from sequencing, but some can identify possible variants.\nAn interesting feature of Omicron is known as S-Gene Dropout or S-Gene Target Failure (SGTF). Some PCR test kits are designed to detect parts of three different genes in SARS-CoV-2. The first sublineage of Omicron to become dominant globally, BA.1, is missing a part of the spike gene detected by this test, so it gives a negative result on one of the three parts of the test. (The Alpha variant also has this feature, but Alpha is rare now.) SGTF was a quick, inexpensive way to track the Omicron variant as it spread throughout the world. Unlike sequencing, which requires more specialized equipment and trained personnel, the SGTF feature allows diagnostic laboratories to detect possible Omicron cases.\nBut Omicron’s evolution added a wrinkle. The BA.2 sublineage cannot be tracked using SGTF, since it is not missing the part of the spike gene that gives a negative result. This was not a problem at first, since BA.1 was dominant, but as BA.2 began showing up more frequently, SGTF became less useful. Often misleadingly called the “Stealth Variant” because it lacked the SGTF feature, it is still detected by diagnostic PCR, but cannot be identified as Omicron without sequencing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Global Omicron sublineage growth. BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.3 all display S-gene target failure (SGTF). SGTF is a characteristic allowing for rapid detection of probable BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.3 Omicron (and previously the Alpha variant). BA.2 does not display SGTF, leading to it being dubbed the “Stealth Variant.”\n\n\n\n\nThe properties of a lineage or sublineage depend on its pattern of mutations.\nEach unique combination of mutations in a variant or subvariant may endow it with different properties. Researchers can make predictions based on past epidemiological or laboratory studies but new, unknown mutations, or mutations in new combinations need to be studied to determine their abilities to infect, replicate, and cause disease. This can be a complex matter, and it becomes more complex with each wave of variants that appears. Teasing out a virus’s inherent virulence or transmissibility from its ability to evade the immune response is especially difficult. The ability of a lineage to avoid the immune system depends on the properties of the virus itself, as well as a person’s immune status, including:\n\nIf a person is immunocompromised\nIf immunity was induced by a vaccine, or infection, or both\nThe vaccine type and number of doses\nThe variant responsible for a previous infection\n\nThere is also the question of the effectiveness of therapeutic treatments. Monoclonal antibody treatments can be quite effective if they are directed at a susceptible virus. Mutations that change the viral structure—especially the spike protein— can render a previously effective treatment useless. Many of the monoclonal antibody treatments that are effective against the Delta variant, for example, are ineffective against the BA.1 sublineage of Omicron. Unfortunately, sotrovimab, which retains some activity against BA.1, appears to be much less effective against the BA.2 sublineage of Omicron. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized a new monoclonal antibody called bebtelovimab, which appears to be effective against the BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2 subvariants of Omicron.\nEvusheld, a long-acting antibody combination therapy given to prevent COVID-19 in immunocompromised individuals, may be less effective against BA.1 and BA.1.1, and the FDA has authorized an increased dose. Fortunately, laboratory studies suggest Evusheld may retain its effectiveness against BA.2.\nAntivirals that are not based on antibodies, such as Remdesivir and Paxlovid, target parts of the virus that are more stable, and thus less likely to be affected by the genetic changes in variants and subvariants. Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, and Nirmatrelvir have been shown to retain their effectiveness against BA.2 in the laboratory.\n\n\nRecombination is still rare, but possible.\nAnother way viruses can generate diversity is through recombination, which happens when two different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 infect the same cell. Two different genomes can then swap out sections, a process that is quite distinct from the errors that cause mutations. Recombination is more likely to happen—and to be detected—when two different variants are circulating at high levels at the same time, such as when Omicron replaced Delta as the dominant variant. Early reports of a recombination event between Delta and Omicron were found to be a laboratory artifact, demonstrating the challenge of accurately detecting recombinants.\nMore recently, strong evidence of such recombinant viruses has been reported. Sometimes called “Deltacron” in media reports, one recombinant virus, first identified in France, has a spike derived from the BA.1 sublineage of Omicron on a background derived from the AY.4.2 sublineage of Delta. Pango has assigned this recombinant to a lineage called XD and the WHO has designated it a Variant Under Monitoring. Another recombinant between BA.1 and Delta, first described in the UK, has been dubbed XF. A recombinant between the BA.1 and BA.2 sublineages of Omicron has been reported in the UK and assigned the Pango lineage XE. Recombinants have also been reported in the Netherlands, Denmark, and the US. While there is no evidence that the recombinant viruses are much of a public health threat, they are being watched closely.\n\n\nAs the virus evolves, it must be monitored.\nThe lack of an SGTF feature in the BA.2 sublineage of Omicron and the presence of recombinants illustrate the problem with reliance on short, characteristic sequences to identify variants. While PCR tests designed to detect variant-specific parts of viral RNA are quicker and more cost-effective than sequencing the whole genome, the constant evolution of the virus, through mutation and recombination, can interfere with the process. This is especially true when levels of community transmission are high. PCR tests recognize very small parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Mutations or recombination events in those short sequences can alter test results. Moreover, by focusing only on those short sequences to identify variants, changes in the rest of the genome are overlooked. While mutations in the spike protein are important for virus binding to host cells and immune evasion, mutations elsewhere in the genome can have profound effects on viral functions.\nAlthough it is impossible to predict when and where the next major variant will arise, there will be more variants. Whether they evolve from known variants or arise independently, it is imperative to detect them as quickly as possible. Whole genome sequencing is the gold standard for identifying variants and subvariants. There are, however, many parts of the world where sequencing capacity is limited. These “sequencing deserts” are places where new, possibly more dangerous variants, like Omicron, can emerge and spread undetected. Until widespread sequencing of representative samples is in place, the world is vulnerable to the emergence of more variants or subvariants. A robust global system of genomic surveillance can help put an end to the current pandemic and prevent the next one."

    "text": "With the United States over a year into its vaccination campaign, all eyes right now are on Covid-19 rates broken out by vaccination status—measures of the number of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths per 100,000 vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals. Shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as well as many state, territorial, and local health departments, rates broken down by vaccination status provide a useful way to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals’ relative risk, assess an individual’s absolute risk, and understand how vaccines are faring over time against challenges like new variants.\nYet with any Covid-19 metric, even apparently simple, straightforward calculations can hide surprising complexity; vaccine breakthrough rates are no exception to that trend. While the CDC shares standardized rates data aggregated from up to 29 US jurisdictions representing 67% of the US total population, it does not provide breakdowns of this data by state and territory. As a result, getting more granular data requires turning to a patchwork of state and territorial data sources, for which, even among those jurisdictions publishing their data, consistency is hard to come by.\nIn this post, we’ll be giving you a guide to interpreting Covid-19 breakthrough rates offered by the CDC, state, and territorial governments—data which can be both very useful when used properly and very difficult to interpret in light of definitional inconsistencies across jurisdictions."

    "text": "What is a breakthrough rate?\n\nAnatomy of a rate\nBefore diving into the complexities of breakthrough rates, it’s worth reviewing what rates are in public health and epidemiology and why they are so useful. Rates in this piece refer to the number of events or outcomes of interest that occur per person in the population susceptible to that event or outcome, over a specified time period (this could be granular, like daily or weekly, but also could be cumulative across the course of the pandemic).\n\n\nThis calculation will tell you the proportion of individuals, in the specified population, that the event has occurred in over the specified time period. If the rate is less than one, that means the event has not happened to every single person in the population over the time period in question. For example, in a population with a 0.5 per capita rate of a given event, we would expect one out of every two people in that population to have experienced that event within the time period.\nRates are so useful because they provide a way of understanding and comparing the frequency of events across populations of different sizes, like Wyoming’s and California’s. By dividing the number of cases in each state by the total population, we can control for those different population sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. 7-day average of Covid-19 cases on February 23, 2022 in California and Wyoming. California has a population nearly 70 times that of Wyoming’s, and had 10,123 cases to Wyoming’s 142 cases. However, California’s rate per 100,000 was 25.6, while Wyoming’s was close at 24.6, highlighting that counts without rates can obscure trends in the data."

    "text": "Vaccine breakthrough rates\nIn the context of vaccine breakthrough data, rates serve a very similar purpose as they do in comparisons across states: they let us fairly compare Covid-19 statistics across differently-sized populations. But instead of state populations, the populations in question for vaccine breakthrough rates are those of vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated individuals.\n\nBreakthrough rates are calculated for a specific time period, in a specific region. Almost all states that report breakthrough data will perform the analogous calculation for the unvaccinated population to compare with vaccine breakthrough rates.\nSince August 2021, the fully vaccinated population has outnumbered the unvaccinated population in the United States. Just as California’s raw case counts are higher than Wyoming’s because California has more residents than Wyoming,** raw counts of vaccine breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, or deaths may look high in comparison to unvaccinated counts just because vaccinated people outnumber unvaccinated people**. Using rates per 100,000 individuals lets us control for those population differences and make a fairer comparison. In the CDC’s data, for example, taking a rate of cases demonstrates there is a larger gap in Covid-19 incidence between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations than the raw counts might imply.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A sequence of illustrative examples showing how raw counts of cases in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated are misleading and can be calculated into rates per 100k and rate ratios for more appropriate population-adjusted comparison\n\n\nUnlike state populations, which are relatively stable over the time frame of interest, the size of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations constantly change as more individuals get vaccinated. That makes calculating rates by vaccination status more data-intensive than calculating other Covid-19 rates. Taking a vaccine breakthrough case rate over time requires a well-defined time series for both the numerator of cases in vaccinated individuals and** for the denominator—the growing size of the vaccinated population.**\nHow states find these population totals can have a big impact on the rates they calculate. Over- or under-estimating the unvaccinated population by using out-of-date or improperly-estimated data can result in erroneous summary figures and require corrections that will be examined below."

    "text": "Rate ratios and vaccine effectiveness\nBy comparing rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths broken down by vaccination status, we can get a picture of the differences in disease incidence and severe disease between these two populations. Rates by vaccine status allow us to calculate metrics that quantify important metrics, like rate ratios and vaccine effectiveness.\nRate ratios (RRs) capture how many more times Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths occur in unvaccinated individuals than vaccinated individuals. For example, if the outcome of interest is cases:\n\nSince vaccinations are expected to reduce the risk of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths across the board, the rate ratios are almost always numbers greater than one, meaning a person who is unvaccinated is at higher risk than one who is not. The rate ratio is a metric often highlighted on state dashboards as well as by the CDC COVID data tracker. The rate ratio number (and definition of what populations are being compared) is often summarized in headlines as an “X” multiple; for example, the CDC page states that “unvaccinated people aged 5 years and older had 2.8X risk of testing positive for COVID-19 in February, compared to people vaccinated with at least a primary series.”\nVaccine effectiveness (VE) is the real-world counterpart measure to vaccine efficacy, which is used in controlled trials to quantify the protective effect of vaccines against Covid-19 cases and severe outcomes. VE measures how much vaccination reduces_ _the number of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths. One way of finding this value is (where RR represents the rate ratio as shown above):\n\nBy comparing population-level rates, VE measures the relative risk of an outcome in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group of similar makeup. For example, a vaccine effectiveness of 65% against infection means there were 65% fewer cases in a group of vaccinated individuals compared to a similar group that is unvaccinated.\nBecause both RR and VE depend on rates, they can be affected by the different methodological choices states make in their data definitions and rate calculations."

    "text": "How do states calculate vaccine breakthrough rates?\nIn the absence of federal standards for public Covid-19 data reporting, states and territories make inconsistent choices about the definitions and methodologies used when calculating rates.\n\nStates make different choices when they define populations of “vaccinated” and “unvaccinated” individuals that comprise rates’ denominators.\nSome states use age adjustment methodologies on top of their rate calculations to control for different age distributions among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations while other states do not age-adjust their rates.\n\nThese discrepancies in definitions and methodologies can make large differences in the value of the rates.\n\nPopulation definitions\nCovid-19 vaccination is not a single, clear-cut event that neatly segments the population into vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. To ascertain individuals’ vaccination status, states have to track them across different doses, and across variable numbers of doses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2. Depending on the vaccine product and other situations, an individual in the US could receive up to 5 vaccine doses.\n\n\nAs a result of this ambiguity, methods for breaking down the population into comparison groups have varied across jurisdictions. Some details of vaccinated and unvaccinated population definitions are too poorly documented to understand how states are handling them. For example, states may not explicitly address how they handle the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and no state addresses how they count additional doses for immunocompromised individuals, who comprise at least 2.7% of the US adult population—or about 7 million people. But with what documentation states do provide, we can observe two major differences in definitions of populations across states, both of which appear to have a large effect on their rates:\n\nWhether or not states include partially vaccinated individuals (with one dose of a two-dose primary series for mRNA vaccines) in their “unvaccinated” populations.\nWhether states are separating out boosted individuals in their “vaccinated” populations.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure 2. 23 states report rates as a time series, but they use different definitions of the “unvaccinated” population denominator. Some lump in partially vaccinated individuals, while others exclude those partially vaccinated or split them out into a separate comparison group.\n\n\n\n\nAre partially vaccinated individuals included in the “unvaccinated” population?\nOf the 23 states that report vaccine breakthrough rate over time, at least 14 states appear to include partially vaccinated individuals in their “unvaccinated” populations, while nine states appear to exclude partially vaccinated individuals from their “unvaccinated” populations (Virginia is the only state that separates “partially vaccinated” into a separate group). Six of these states did not define denominators in detail, so assumptions were made to determine how their unvaccinated populations are defined.\nStates that include partially vaccinated individuals may appear to have lower rates of cases in their unvaccinated populations than states that exclude partially vaccinated individuals. In turn, these states may appear to have lower RRs and VEs than states excluding partially vaccinated individuals. This is especially true when the share of partially vaccinated is high, whether because many individuals have not completed their primary series or because of a recent uptick in vaccinations. The inclusion or exclusion of partially vaccinated individuals in the unvaccinated population is a critical piece of information for understanding and comparing the metrics reported by states and is one of the criteria in the Pandemic Prevention Institute’s Vaccine Breakthrough Reporting Scorecard.\nThe decision to include or exclude partially vaccinated individuals can make a big difference to unvaccinated rates, and in turn RR and VE calculations. For example, on its dashboard, Virginia breaks out rates and RRs by fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated populations. Its data demonstrates a large difference in rates between unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals. Data from other states, like New York, supports this observation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3. Covid-19 case rates in Virginia for week ending March 26, 2022. The data indicates that unvaccinated people developed Covid-19 at a rate 6.7x that of fully vaccinated people and 3x that of partially vaccinated people.\n\n\n\n\nAre boosted individuals included in the “vaccinated” population?\nEffectiveness of the primary vaccine series against infection—and (to a lesser degree) against severe disease and death—wanes over time, especially with Omicron being the dominant circulating variant. Booster doses can provide additional protection, but also introduce additional complexity. Just as combining partially vaccinated and unvaccinated populations can obscure key differences between the two populations, combining boosted populations with those who have completed their primary series into a single “vaccinated” population can obscure important trends. Data from states, like California, that separate out these two categories demonstrates large differences between these two populations.\nCurrently, only 11 states out of the 23 that provide time series of vaccine breakthrough rates break down their fully vaccinated rates into categories of those who received their primary series and those who have received their booster; all other states that report a time series either combine the two categories or don’t provide clear data definitions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: 11 states reporting vaccine breakthrough rates data distinguish in their “vaccinated” group between those vaccinated with a primary series of doses only and those who have received an additional/booster dose.\n\n\n\n\nConnecting vaccination data\nDocumenting breakthrough cases requires connecting clinical information (testing, hospitalization, and deaths) with the complete vaccination record of that individual. Errors in connecting data can result in the misclassification of cases. For example:\n\nIf the vaccination status of a vaccinated person who contracts Covid-19 is unknown or unrecorded, that individual may be incorrectly classified as unvaccinated and therefore a non-breakthrough case.\nIf an individual’s second or third vaccine dose is not connected to previous doses, that vaccination may be misclassified as a first dose.\n\nSimply determining which individuals represent breakthrough cases can be an administrative quagmire; case and vaccination datasets are usually housed in different data systems. Most states have a centralized immunization information system (IIS) containing vaccination data, which will often not contain information on individuals vaccinated through federal and other supplemental systems. The records in IIS must then be cross-referenced with one or more complementary data systems that contain case information, often done through an automated system. The information states use to connect data (the individual’s name, date of birth, and address, for example) may vary—as does how closely the data has to align in order to be considered a match.\nIn Texas, for instance, only exact matches between case data and vaccination records for first name, last name, and date of birth will be considered a breakthrough case. While some states also incorporate cases matched by hand by local health departments or other interviewers, if a breakthrough case cannot be correctly identified, it will usually be misclassified as a non-breakthrough case. Because these misclassifications reduce the number of breakthrough cases that can be counted, they may artificially reduce the breakthrough rate and increase the unvaccinated rate, leading to an inflated RR and VE calculation for a given population. Given how frequently this kind of error occurs in more general situations, this kind of distortion represents a real challenge for incompatible data systems.\nThe CDC and some states like Washington have introduced methods to account for measurement errors that overestimate how many people have been vaccinated. Difficulty correctly matching booster doses to their initial series can lead to third doses inadvertently being classified as first doses, leading to the impossible figure of over 100% of people in a given age range having received their first dose. Likewise, difficulty determining the correct population figures used to calculate rates—for instance, due to there being fewer people or shifts in the population distribution by age since the last census—can lead to implausibly high vaccination percentages and, conversely, a derived count of unvaccinated people that is too low, which would lead to an overestimation of rates in the unvaccinated.\n\n\nAge-adjusted rates\nEven if every record were perfectly matched and every population definition perfectly standardized, inherent differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations still exist. Age is a particularly strong predictor of Covid-19 outcomes, and in general also a predictor of vaccine status. Due to a number of factors like the time at which they became eligible and perceived risk, the vaccinated population overall is likely to be older than the unvaccinated population. Since older people are generally more at risk for worse outcomes than younger people, RR and vaccine effectiveness calculations could be biased toward worse outcomes based solely on the age distribution of the individuals who are vaccinated.\nAlong these lines, we see states report two types of rates:\n\nCrude rates—calculated using the total number of outcomes in the total without adjusting for variations in a factor like age distribution\nAge-adjusted rates—calculated by adjusting the crude rate to reflect the age distribution of a “standard population,” usually the state or federal population as a whole.\n\nStates that use a crude rate risk distorting the effectiveness of vaccines at a given point in time. Switching to an age-adjusted rate as Colorado did in the fall of 2021 can help create a more accurate picture of vaccine effectiveness over time. However, states using age-adjusted rates must choose a dataset to come up with the best estimate of who is currently living in their jurisdiction. This choice alone can introduce discrepancies across states because:\n\nthey may choose different census data sources\nthey may choose sources from different years\nolder data may not accurately reflect the current population in a jurisdiction\n\nOnce the state or public health body selects a data source, they adjust the crude rates as if both the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations had the same age distribution as the standard population to minimize the confounding effect of differences in age structure. A number of states, with varying population data sources, use age-adjusted rates in their assessment of breakthrough data.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Of the 23 states reporting breakthrough rates, some report age-adjusted rates, some report crude rates, some report disaggregated rates by age group, and for some it’s unclear if and how rates are adjusted for differences in age distribution.\n\n\nThe difference in crude versus age-adjusted rates can also be compared in data compiled at a multi-state level by the CDC:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: CDC-compiled data shows weekly case and death rates per 100K by vaccine status with age adjustment compared to without age adjustment (crude rates).\n\n\nAdjusting for different age distributions can make a big difference in reported rates. In the above figure, that effect is especially pronounced in reporting the death rates. The age-adjusted death rate is much higher than the crude rate in the unvaccinated population, while it is lower when age-adjusted in the boosted population. Rates can also be presented broken out by age group to show the relative risk within and across age groups, as the CDC does for cases, deaths, and hospitalizations aggregated across multiple state and local jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: CDC-compiled data shows the relative risk by vaccine status and age group as weekly rate ratios and rates per 100K for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths before and after Omicron became dominant. Hospitalization data source does not provide rates for the 12-17 age group.\n\n\n1\nIn light of these methodological differences, looking at multiple rate data sources and studies in aggregate can inform a more complete understanding of VE. For example, the United Kingdom’s Health Security Agency (UKHSA) evaluates a range of VE studies to provide consensus estimates of VE against different outcomes of Omicron by vaccine product, dose, and time since last dose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4. UKHSA reports expert panel consensus estimates of VE against different Omicron outcomes by mRNA vaccine product and time since completion of primary series or booster dose"

    "text": "Putting it all together\nIf we assume these breakthrough case, hospitalization, and death counts, our numerator, are a reasonable reflection of facts on the ground, the challenge remains to determine the proper population figure to take as** our denominator **(despite unstandardized definitions of vaccinated, unvaccinated, and boosted and differing data sources for overall population).\nIf we assume our numerator and denominator are both reasonable, we now need to understand them across time. A time series of daily or weekly rates provides a more responsive way of seeing how the pandemic is changing and what interventions may be necessary to address it. This requires accounting for the changing composition of who is making up the unvaccinated, vaccinated, and boosted groups over time.\nUsing only crude population rates can make interpretation difficult, as age is a major factor in both who is likely to be vaccinated as well as who is likely to have a poor outcome. Age adjustment can compensate for these variations, and rate ratios broken out by age and vaccination status can show how the risks for different subpopulations vary across time. However, even these age-adjusted figures can be subject to other unexpected biases that require more thorough, comprehensive analysis.\nAn actionable and interpretable measure of risk by vaccination status over time and in real time requires, among other things: standardized definitions and transparent methodologies, the ability to match data across sometimes incompatible data systems, and the funding and dedication to do so. States handle methodology about numerators and denominators (and the figures derived from them) in differing and often unclear ways. This results in a patchwork of unstandardized jurisdictional rates data. This means we have to be comfortable with uncertainty and triangulate across our best data sources to interpret trends in breakthrough data.\nAs new variants emerge in a population with an increasingly complex vaccination landscape, we hope that states and jurisdictions will become more transparent about their methodologies and limitations. A lack of consistency in states’ reporting is one of the reasons our team decided to stop collecting breakthrough data. The federal government could help by providing disaggregated rate breakdowns by jurisdiction in addition to national rates. Looking forward, well-documented, standardized methods will be needed to handle the challenges presented by an evolving virus as it encounters continuously changing levels of immunity in both individuals and populations."

    "title": "The Challenge of Measuring Vaccine Effectiveness",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Hope arrived in a syringe. Effective vaccines were developed in record time, with the promise of ending the current pandemic. The scientific discoveries behind that quick vaccine development are also key to halting future pandemics.\nOver the course of two days, Moderna and Pfizer announced the results of their phase 3 vaccine trials. Both vaccines had more than 90% efficacy against symptomatic disease, an efficacy much higher than the minimum standard of 50% set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Even 75% was considered optimistic by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The quick development of such highly efficacious vaccines—and the emergency use authorization soon thereafter—led many to predict that the end of the pandemic was in sight.\nGlobally, 36 different vaccines have been approved for use by national regulatory agencies as of May 2022. Yet the pandemic continues, and breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated (and boosted) individuals are increasingly common. There are numerous reasons for the continuation of the pandemic, but attempting to tease out the role of vaccine effectiveness is a complicated matter.\n\nEfficacy and Effectiveness are not the same thing.\nThe original measures of vaccine efficacy were determined by tightly controlled clinical trials. Vaccine effectiveness, on the other hand, is measured in “real life,” in a variety of situations. As the immune status of individuals varies due to vaccination and infection, and as the virus evolves, the picture becomes murkier. Great care must be taken in interpreting vaccine effectiveness from research studies, and even more care is required when inferring vaccine effectiveness from breakthrough infection data reporting systems.\n\n\nCrude estimates of vaccine effectiveness from vaccine breakthrough data can yield unexpected or inaccurate results.\nVaccine effectiveness (VE) measures how much vaccination reduces the rate of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths in a vaccinated population compared to an unvaccinated population. In theory, converting vaccine breakthrough rates to VE may seem straightforward, but how the rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations have been tracked, calculated, adjusted, and controlled varies widely across different sources and studies. These choices can introduce biases that can have a tangible impact on how a vaccine’s effectiveness is interpreted at a given time. In fact, the practice is strongly discouraged by professional bodies like the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), writing that, even if available,\n\n“This raw data should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness as the data does not take into account inherent biases present such as differences in risk, behaviour and testing in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.”\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) provides further guidance on conducting VE evaluations, stating that, while crude VE estimates based on reported vaccine breakthrough data can serve as a rapid screening tool for assessing vaccine performance, especially in monitoring the impact of emerging variants, crude estimates that differ from expectations should trigger more rigorous evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. WHO guidance on conducting VE evaluations using breakthrough case data outlines potential reasons for crude VE estimates to differ from expectation based on clinical trial and observational study results. Differing crude estimates may have valid or invalid reasons that require more rigorous studies to examine.\n\n\n\n\nControlled studies can yield more reliable measurements of VE.\nMore rigorously controlled studies can often account for a wider variety of potential confounding factors. For example, such studies can be designed from the outset to gather more granular data—often to the individual or household level—to help tease the competing strands of explanation apart. Controlled studies use a variety of techniques and analyses to help provide a complementary and overall more complete picture of which factors are driving changes in vaccine performance at a given time. These studies are generally large enough and have data detailed enough to test possible explanations for VE estimates that differ from expected values.\n\nStudies can be designed to separate populations by their time since completing a primary series or booster. This clarifies timing when subjects are transitioning from the broad categories of “fully vaccinated with primary series” to “boosted.”\nStratifying outcomes by time period or variant predominance can more precisely account for differences in vaccine protection due to the ebb and flow of new variants, since VE in the time of Delta can be very different from VE in the time of Omicron.\nThey can look at VE for different vaccine products and dose combinations, since the different doses, molecular compositions, and platforms may have different outcomes, and different populations may have received different vaccines.\nOutcomes such as asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, hospitalization, critical illness, or death can be more precisely defined, measured, and separately assessed.\nAn increasingly complex population immunity landscape comprising those with varying levels of vaccine-induced immunity (from which vaccine products, number of doses, time elapsed since vaccination) as well as infection-induced immunity (prior infection by which variant and how much time has elapsed) can be disentangled.\n\nThe original vaccine trials were randomized controlled trials, where some subjects were given the vaccine and others were given a placebo to determine vaccine efficacy. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has ongoing systems in place to monitor infection in long-term care facilities and Covid-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in the general population, comparing these outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Case studies and clinical observations can be used to highlight initial findings, such as the reports from an early outbreak of the Delta variant in Massachusetts. Information gleaned from these observations cannot reliably estimate vaccine effectiveness because of confounding factors and a lack of controls, but they can be used to inform more carefully controlled studies.\nSeveral kinds of studies can be used to more precisely examine real-life vaccine effectiveness. Household contact studies are designed to determine the level of transmission that occurs from infected individuals to their close contacts (and to see if vaccination affects the level of transmission). Case-control studies (including test-negative designs) can identify similarly matched individuals with and without Covid-19 and compare their vaccination status. Cohort studies can look at individuals with different levels of vaccination and follow those people to see if they go on to experience the designated outcome (such as infection, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, or death).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2. Key vaccine effectiveness studies and monitoring systems used in the US in an interactive list that is sortable and searchable by name, outcome, population, or study design.\n\n\n\n\nControlled studies can also produce misleading results.\nEven within these more rigorous study designs, the devil can be in the details.\n\nSample sizes can be small, particularly when looking at many subgroups or when there has been less time to vaccinate a group (as with younger children most recently becoming eligible for vaccination).\nOutcomes can be rare, which is why data on deaths in younger populations is often too sparse to draw strong conclusions.\nConfidence intervals, which show a range of values that are consistent with the data from a study, can be very wide. They can also overlap, meaning comparison groups may not be significantly different.\n\nBecause of these issues, study findings showing only small differences or wide confidence intervals without a strong evidence base are sometimes treated conservatively with an honest “We don’t know right now.” Any new information, such as the newly emerging trends described above, should be scrutinized closely and compared with other sources. It may be a trend that indicates something real and significant, or might just be a blip on our pandemic data landscape.\n\n\nThere are many things to consider when interpreting VE studies.\nIt may be tempting to read a news headline—or even a tweet—to draw conclusions about what a VE study reports, but it is important to find out more about how the study was conducted. Some characteristics of studies that can affect how they may be interpreted include:\n\nStudy design: Different study designs can have advantages and disadvantages.\nSample size: A small sample size is more likely to show less conclusive and more wide-ranging results.\nSubject characteristics: The age of subjects can have a large effect on VE. Other characteristics might include immunocompromised status, comorbidities, access to testing or healthcare, or behavioral characteristics, such as occupational exposure or level of risk tolerance.\nVaccine product and dose: It is important to note the vaccine manufacturer and type, along with the number of doses and interval between doses. The composition of “vaccinated” and “unvaccinated” populations might be affected by the inclusion of partially vaccinated individuals, or those who received a booster.\nPrior infection: As the number of infections rises, the number of previously infected individuals grows. A prior infection can affect vaccine effectiveness, sometimes acting as an additional dose.\nEndpoint and outcome definition: VE can be measured against an array of outcomes of increasing severity, including: infection (which may be asymptomatic), transmission, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. How these particular outcomes are defined can also lead to clear differences in VE assessments, even against outcomes that could fall in the same broad category.\nReference group definition: VE can also be measured relative to different reference groups for comparison. Most are measuring the benefit of vaccination against a fully unvaccinated group but the value of booster doses could be compared against those who received a primary vaccine series. An even newer example is the evaluation of 4th dose effectiveness compared to primary series plus boosted (totaling 3 mRNA doses) recipients in Israel.\nWhen the study was conducted: The initial vaccine trials performed in 2020, when the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain dominated, yielded different results from newer VE studies performed when the Delta variant was dominant. Those, in turn, will differ from the newest studies against Omicron due to different transmissibility, virulence, and immune evasion properties of these new variants.\nTime since vaccination: Vaccine-induced immunity wanes over time, which is particularly evident with Omicron as the dominant circulating variant.\n\n\n\nThe vaccines remain highly effective.\nNo single study (out of more than 1,000 documented by the WHO) can determine vaccine effectiveness. Systematic reviews of these studies, with a critical eye to the above considerations, offer a more complete assessment of vaccine effectiveness. The best-controlled studies, however, consistently show that boosters significantly improve VE against both symptomatic disease and more severe outcomes, even during Omicron’s predominance.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Summary of US vaccine effectiveness studies estimating 2- and 3-dose mRNA VE over time vs different outcomes in adults during Omicron predominance. VE is higher against more severe outcomes. Receiving a booster increases protection across all outcomes and remains high among immunocompetent individuals 4–6 months after dose.\n\n\nGoing forward, these questions and studies will only become more complicated. Population immunity will continue to wax and wane. More vaccines, with varying targets, will come to market. The number of doses each person has received (and/or infections that person has experienced) will increase. It will then be even more important for data and studies to be presented transparently, with both their strengths and limitations clearly laid out. Individuals will rely on this information to make choices in their everyday lives. Policy makers will rely on it to fashion next steps. Increasing complexity will require more sustained investment in planning and communication."

    "title": "Tracking SARS-CoV-2 and its Variants in Wastewater: An Old Technique is Yielding Powerful New Insights in the COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Hospitalization and death rates, and case counts obtained from clinical samples, can provide information about the trajectory of the pandemic, but they do not paint a complete picture. Many infected people are asymptomatic or go untested, and the lag time between testing and reporting is often delayed beyond useful purpose. With a long history and a strong scientific basis, wastewater monitoring adds critical data and insights into a rapidly evolving situation. From national systems down to the neighborhood level, or even to individual buildings, data obtained from wastewater can complement clinical data to support evidence-based public health policies and decisions in numerous ways.\n\nWastewater has played a role in disease surveillance for centuries.\nFor thousands of years, humans have recognized that their waste could harbor disease, and sanitation practices were developed to keep sewage separate from drinking water. In a classic 1854 epidemiology example, John Snow used a map of cholera cases in London to track the origin of the outbreak—a pump that supplied water contaminated with sewage. To stop people from using the water, he removed the pump handle. We now know that waste can inform as well as infect. Wastewater testing provides important insights into the health of a population by detecting chemicals, disease-causing organisms, and other markers of public well-being.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A portion of John Snow’s 1854 map of the London Cholera outbreak showing the locations of cholera cases and the source - a contaminated water pump located at the intersection of Broad Street and Cambridge Street (now Lexington Street)\n\n\nFor decades, wastewater testing has played an important role in the global effort to eradicate polio, especially in resource-poor environments. Poliovirus detected in wastewater can alert officials to the presence of the virus in a community, even in the absence of clinical disease. Genetic analysis of pathogen-positive wastewater samples can help track a virus to its source and monitor a virus as it evolves. Control measures, including vaccination, hospital resources, and therapeutics, can then be effectively and efficiently targeted to a specific location.\n\n\nWastewater surveillance is an important part of the public health response to COVID-19.\nUnlike poliovirus and the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which are transmitted through water contaminated with human waste, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the air. Although there is no evidence of COVID-19 transmission through wastewater, about half of infected individuals can excrete the virus in their feces, even when they do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. Viral shedding in feces can occur 3-5 days before symptoms appear, if symptoms appear at all.\nData about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can be used to monitor trends in community transmission and to inform public health decisions. Wastewater surveillance can provide early indications of community transmission or surges in COVID-19, sometimes preceding reports of positive clinical samples by 1-2 weeks, giving health systems critical lead time.** **Declines in wastewater virus levels may also precede drops in clinical cases.\nIn the early months of the pandemic, hundreds of studies demonstrated the feasibility of using wastewater surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2. On a national level, several countries, including Australia, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and Sweden, were able to pivot existing wastewater surveillance programs to COVID-19. Currently, at least 58 countries monitor wastewater at some level. Many of the more than 16,000 water treatment plants within the US are monitoring wastewater, and the CDC tracker is a first step toward a coordinated national system in the US. As more sites come online, and as methods are standardized, the value of the tracker will continue to increase after this promising first step.\nWastewater sampling at a centralized water treatment facility can provide information for a city or region within its sewershed, the area from which wastewater arrives at a single treatment plant. Sampling at smaller sewer catchment areas within the larger sewersheds, such as via manholes, can provide more focused information, sometimes down to the neighborhood level. Any “hot spots” that are detected can then be identified for targeted public health intervention and mitigation.\nOne such “hot spot” was detected in Louisville, Kentucky during the onset of their 2021 Omicron variant surge. The Pandemic Prevention Institute (PPI) partners at the University of Louisville track SARS-CoV-2 in small wastewater catchment areas, which complements the clinical data collected by the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health & Wellness. Prior to Omicron, clinical cases reported within the 40212 ZIP code had been roughly comparable to those of the city, but beginning in November 2021, wastewater data painted a different picture. With wastewater, Louisville was able to zoom in more closely into the community and noted that only part of the 40212 ZIP code was showing unusual patterns of virus prevalence. Specifically, in contrast to the clinical case data, wastewater data showed much higher levels of virus in the Shawnee Park area of 40212, compared to the 34th Street area and to the larger sewershed that includes both Shawnee Park and 34th Street. Such findings suggested a need for localized investigation and potential interventions in the Shawnee Park area, an opportunity that would have been delayed or missed completely by relying on clinical data alone.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ZIP code-level clinical data for 40212, the Louisville, Kentucky ZIP code encompassing the Shawnee Park and 34th Street catchment areas (top), compares case rates in that ZIP code (orange) to those of Jefferson County as a whole (blue). Wastewater data (bottom) shows higher SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations detected in Shawnee Park wastewater (pink) than in surrounding wastewater catchment areas, including 34th Street (blue), and in the larger Morris Forman Water Quality Treatment Center catchment area (purple)\n\n\nEven more localized data can be obtained by examining wastewater from individual facilities, such as prisons, schools, and long-term-care centers. Samples from airports, aircraft, and cruise ships can reveal infections among travelers. Universities and colleges have used wastewater data from dormitories to detect and control outbreaks. For example, in August 2020, the University of Arizona detected SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from one dormitory. All 311 residents were tested, and two asymptomatic cases were discovered. Those students were isolated, likely averting an outbreak.\nWhen an outbreak is detected in a neighborhood or building, targeted control measures can be initiated. Depending on the circumstances, these might include:\n\npublic health outreach and education\nquarantine or isolation\nclinical screening/testing, vaccination\nsurge staffing for hospitals\ntargeted distribution of stockpiled inventory of therapeutics, ventilators, or oxygen\nincreased masking\nsocial restrictions\n\nThe public health response to such an outbreak can be tailored to the specific population in question, with attention to factors such as language, culture, disability, literacy, mobility, age, and internet access. Mobile testing and vaccination clinics may also be redirected to the area.\n\n\nWastewater testing has been particularly powerful in tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in November 2021 has been a turning point in the COVID-19 pandemic. When it was declared a Variant of Concern by the World Health Organization on November 26, 2021, little was known about Omicron’s growth characteristics, transmissibility, immune evasion, ability to cause serious disease, or even its whereabouts. What was known was its genetic sequence. By sharing the sequence rapidly into the global GISAID domain, scientists in South Africa provided researchers and public health officials worldwide the information they needed to detect and track the rapidly spreading variant in clinical samples and in wastewater.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Global prevalence of variants of concern, showing successive waves of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants.\n\n\nGenomic surveillance has been critical for tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants. Reliance on clinical samples for genomic data can be insufficient, however, when healthcare and laboratory systems are limited or overwhelmed. Globally, only 13 countries or territories have sequenced and publicly shared more than 5% of cases with GISAID in the last 90 days. The result is a spotty and geographically skewed picture of variant presence, evolution, and spread. By turning to wastewater, a non-traditional data source that functions independent of medical systems, public health officials and researchers around the world have filled critical gaps in pathogen genomic surveillance.\nAs the Omicron variant spread across the globe, wastewater was often the first indication that it had reached a community. Early evidence of Omicron’s presence in the US was detected in wastewater in California, Colorado, and New York City, as well as in Houston, where the PPI partners with the Houston Health Department. In Kentucky, the PPI partners at the University of Louisville detected Omicron in the wastewater before a confirmed case was reported from a clinical sample in the county. The researchers there were also able to track the rapid change in the dominant variant, from Delta to Omicron, in each of the larger wastewater sewersheds, as well as in the smaller catchment areas within the sewersheds.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Louisville Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Variant Surveillance: Wastewater testing can identify SARS-CoV-2 variant proportions in wastewater for small catchment areas around Louisville and at larger Water Quality Treatment Centers. This visualization shows the spread of different variants over the past ten months in each wastewater catchment area monitored by the Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, KY INBRE Bioinformatics and Genomics Cores, University of Louisville.\n\n\nAdvances in wastewater testing for COVID-19 can facilitate surveillance for many pathogens, including respiratory pathogens like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Wastewater can also be used to monitor other global threats, like antimicrobial resistant bacteria in disease-causing organisms. With the technology to monitor wastewater in place, communities will be better able to quickly identify and track new disease threats as they surge and wane.\n\n\nStandardization and increased representation can improve the utility of wastewater data.\nWastewater surveillance has come into its own during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of a comprehensive public health strategy, data derived from sewage has proven invaluable in the response to outbreaks, especially where clinical testing is lacking in capacity, access, or representation. It is not, however, a standalone technology, and works best in concert with other clinical and epidemiological studies. Issues still remain to be addressed. Unstandardizedsampling and laboratory methods make it difficult to compare data across different municipalities. Globally, many areas lack the physical wastewater and laboratory facilities to conduct this kind of surveillance, as well as the data infrastructure to perform the required analysis. Ethical concerns, including privacy and a history of misuse of wastewater data may require extra care and education to support the implementation of wastewater surveillance systems in different areas.\nAs the full potential of wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 begins to be realized, its advantages are increasingly appreciated by the public health community and the general public. As a leading indicator, it can alert communities to the presence of new variants or an imminent surge in clinical cases. Wastewater monitoring is cost-effective, anonymous, and passive. It is not dependent on access to health care. It provides a more timely, equitable, and representative picture of the level of virus circulating in a community than clinical data, because it encompasses data from individuals who:\n\ncan be symptomatic, asymptomatic or presymptomatic\ncannot access testing\nchoose not to test\ntest at home and do not report their results\n\nThe epidemiological value of wastewater monitoring has been vividly demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of communities that are monitoring wastewater both in the US and worldwide is increasing, though the practice is still more common in high income countries. Accessible data and increased participation of low-and middle-income countries will add additional value. While national programs are vital, local initiatives can provide important information to inform public health decisions. National and international partners can play a vital role in empowering local programs and providing targeted feedback to help assist workers on the ground. This collaboration can help provide rapid, equitable knowledge about the ongoing evolution of a pandemic on a global level. The Pandemic Prevention Institute is working with partners in Ghana, India, and two sites in Bangladesh to enhance wastewater testing in those countries.\nLocal disease surveillance has global impact, since lack of surveillance in one region can result in the emergence and unmonitored spread of viral variants and new pathogens that endanger the rest of the world. Wastewater surveillance will play an increasingly important role in controlling outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, as well as future, as yet unknown, pathogens, thus helping to prevent the next pandemic."
