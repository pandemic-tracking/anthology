    "text": "SARS-CoV-2 has already mutated since it was first identified and will continue to do so.\nRobust global genomic sequencing is the best tool for tracking existing variants and detecting new ones.\nThis information enables public health officials, governments, and communities to take action that can save lives. The more high-quality data that is available, the more effective the response.\nEven as new variants emerge, vaccines, masking, and social distancing remain critical to ending the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nEvery week, it seems, coverage of existing and emerging variants multiplies, with each headline scarier than the last. Terms like “Superstrains,” “Double Mutants,” “Delta Plus” and “Covid on Steroids” are attention-grabbing but do little to convey what countries and communities should expect–or do–in terms of these variant viruses. This document is designed as a guide to what matters, what to watch for, and why.\nBottom line: Effective surveillance that detects emerging variants is critical to the Covid-19 response. It’s not yet universal, even in countries like the U.S. where there is widespread vaccine access. It will be crucial to scale surveillance along with vaccine access worldwide, since careful study of their characteristics can determine which variants need to be more closely monitored as possible public health threats.\n\nWhat’s a variant?\nAll viruses mutate, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Mutations are the occasional mistakes that occur when a virus replicates–or makes copies of itself–inside host cells. Usually, those mistakes make no difference in how the virus functions. Sometimes the mistakes even weaken the virus, and viruses with those mutations die out. Once in a while, however, an accumulation of advantageous mutations can make a virus better at infecting cells, causing disease, evading the immune system, or spreading within a population, thereby being designated a “variant” of the wild-type (original) virus.\n\n\nHow do variants get found–and are they all alike?\nScientists track these SARS-CoV-2 variants, those with mutations that differ in such a way to make them clinically or epidemiologically important. Detecting variants usually requires sequencing the entire genome of a virus, that is, all of its genes. This process takes longer than the diagnostic PCR test, which is designed to detect only small parts of the genome. Variant surveillance, accomplished by sequencing a representative sample of viral specimens in a population, is essential to determine if new variants are emerging or if known variants are becoming more widespread. Additional epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory studies are used to assess the properties of variants. Possible characteristics of variants might include:\n\nInterference with diagnostic tests (The Alpha variant, for example, has a genetic change that results in false negative PCR results in one diagnostic test kit.)\nIncreased ability to bind to or multiply in cells in the laboratory\nIncreased ability to grow in the laboratory in the presence of antiviral antibodies\nIncreased community transmission within a population\nReduced effectiveness of therapeutic drugs such as monoclonal antibodies\nIncreased incidence or severity of disease in infected individuals\nAbility to infect previously infected individuals (reinfection)\nAbility to infect fully vaccinated individuals (vaccine breakthrough)\n\n\n\nWhat happens when a variant is found–and what’s in a name?\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) is monitoring more than 50 different variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most are unlikely to be problematic, but a handful can be classified by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO into four categories, based on genetic or epidemiological evidence:\n\nAlerts for Further Monitoring are variants with genetic markers that are suspected to affect virus characteristics but require enhanced monitoring and evidence to assess their epidemiological impact. Former variants of concern and variants of interest may be monitored for an extended period of time under this classification. Some organizations designate variants in this category as Variants Under Monitoring (VUM).\nVariants of Interest (VOI) are those with genetic markers predicted or known to affect virus characteristics and identified in multiple cases of Covid-19, in clusters or in multiple countries.\nVariants of Concern (VOC) are variants that have been demonstrated to be more transmissible, cause more severe disease, or make vaccines, diagnostic tests, medications, or public health measures less effective.\nVariants of High Consequence (VOHC) are those that cause significant reductions in the effectiveness of diagnostic tests, vaccines, or therapeutic drugs or cause significantly more severe disease. As of mid-July 2021, no variant has been designated a VOHC.\n\nGroups of scientists name variants with different strings of letters and numbers that trace their genetic lineages, which can be confusing to the public. News organizations and others addressing non-scientific audiences have attempted to simplify the naming of variants by referring to the countries in which they first emerged, but that can result in stigma, blame, or prejudice. In an effort to identify viruses in easier-to-pronounce and non-stigmatizing ways, the WHO recently proposed a new system of labeling variants of interest and concern using letters of the Greek alphabet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO label\nPango Lineage\nGISAID clade/lineage\nNextstrain clade\nEarliest documented samples\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\nB.1.1.7\nGRY\n20I (V1)\nUnited Kingdom, Sep-2020\n\n\nBeta\nB.1.351 B.1.351.2 B.1.351.3\nGH/501Y.V2\n20H (V2)\nSouth Africa, May-2020\n\n\nGamma\nP.1 P.1.1 P.1.2\nGR/501Y.V3\n20J (V3)\nBrazil, Nov-2020\n\n\nDelta\nB.1.617.2 AY.1 AY.2\nG/478K.V1\n21A\nIndia, Oct-2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Current Variants of Concern (VOC), as designated by the WHO\n\n\nEach country can classify variants based on local prevalence and transmission rates, and the WHO can determine if variants are of global interest or concern. Variant designations can change, as well. For example, the Epsilon variant was designated a VOC by the CDC, but not by the WHO, because it was not widespread outside of the U.S. and Mexico. The CDC has since downgraded Epsilon to a VOI. On July 6, 2021, the WHO recognized four VOIs (Eta, Iota, Kappa, and Lambda), and reclassified three former VOIs (Epsilon, Zeta, and Theta) as “Alerts for further monitoring.” Variant classifications may escalate or de-escalate based on emerging evidence, including a change in relative risk compared to other circulating variants.\nThese designations reflect evidence-informed predictions of the risks a variant might pose to individual and public health, which can be obscured by media coverage. It is nearly impossible to predict exactly how a new mutation or a new variant will affect the spread of Covid-19. Careful study of the data, however, can help public health authorities track, or even control variants that emerge. Global surveillance of emerging variants can enable vaccine developers to monitor the likelihood of vaccine breakthrough infections and consider strategies for booster shots and new vaccines in the future.\n\n\nWhat’s a dominant lineage–and why does it matter?\nIn the United States, at least 33 states report variant data publicly on a regular basis. The presence of variants is usually expressed as a proportion of total samples sequenced. The CDC estimates that as of July 3, 28.7% of viruses sequenced in the US were variants of concern of the Alpha lineage, 51.7% were of the Delta lineage and 8.9% were of the Gamma lineage. The distribution of variants across the US is not uniform, and significant regional differences exist.\nAll VOI and VOC worldwide merit close observation. Some remain restricted to outbreaks in limited geographical areas. Others can rapidly spread worldwide, displacing other circulating viruses and becoming what’s known as the “dominant lineage.” The Alpha variant, for example, was first detected in the UK in September 2020 and became the dominant lineage there by December 2020. By spring, the Alpha variant was detected in over 150 countries and had become the dominant lineage in the US. The Delta variant is on track to have a similar global effect, playing a significant role in the devastating spring surge in India and displacing the Alpha variant as the dominant lineage in the UK in May 2021 and US in July 2021. The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 was upgraded from a VOI to a VOC by the WHO on May 11, and by the CDC on June 15, 2021. Its spread during early 2021 can be examined from India, where it was first discovered, through the UK where it was introduced relatively early via travel, and to the US where it arose as the dominant global variant. A robust approach to sequencing variants and tracking their spread allows countries to understand and anticipate the arrival of dominant variants, which may be more transmissible, as is the case with the Delta variant, or have different impacts on disease progression. Sequencing allows countries to remain one step ahead of variants, which can be crucial for planning and response.\n\n\nThe GISAID initiative\nThe GISAID Initiative promotes the rapid sharing of data from all influenza viruses and the coronavirus causing Covid-19. This includes genetic sequence and related clinical and epidemiological data associated with human viruses, and geographical as well as species-specific data associated with avian and other animal viruses, to help researchers understand how viruses evolve and spread during epidemics and pandemics. GISAID’s EpiCoV™ database provides by far the largest global collection of genetic sequences and associated metadata of SARS-CoV-2, with about 2.25 million entries as of July 2021. The Rockefeller Foundation is working to expand global genomic sequencing capacity, with plans to collaborate with GISAID, advancing its pathogen data-sharing platform to enable more rapid sharing of data to trigger public health action and development of vaccines and diagnostic tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Global variant trends\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the Delta variant say about sequencing and response strategy as of mid-2021?\n\nIndia: Without vaccines or a resilient health system, surveillance falters.\nThe progenitor of the Delta variant (B.1.617) was first identified in late 2020 in India. Of the three variants derived from that progenitor, one (Kappa, or B.1.617.1) has been designated a VOI by the WHO and another (Delta, or B.1.617.2) is designated a VOC. Between January and April 2021, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequencing consortium (INSACOG) was sequencing approximately 0.75% of positive cases (although the original stated target was to randomly sequence 5%). In March 2021, INSACOG identified Delta as a public health threat, due to a spike in cases and the presence of several concerning mutations in samples taken in the prior three months. The massive spring increase in cases in India, almost all of which were the due in large part to the Delta variant, which spread rapidly in the context of and low vaccination rates, overwhelmed already strained healthcare systems throughout the country. This burden greatly reduced the percentage of samples sequenced. It’s critical to pair investments in health systems and surveillance, so that epidemic surges trigger vaccination, care and treatment without letting sequencing lag behind.\nBased on the limited available data, by mid-April 2021, Delta became the dominant lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in India. Assuming the most recent two weeks of data is incomplete, data derived from GISAID on 6/28 indicates India sequenced an average of 0.04% of its Covid-19 cases in the month of June. During this time, their median number of days (median lag time) from specimen collection to sequencing and GISAID submission was 17 days. There are many variables affecting turnaround time. The vast majority of sites worldwide lack sequencing capabilities, for example, and it takes time to transfer the samples to sequencing laboratories. Nevertheless, a target of less than seven days is reasonable and achievable in many places. A functioning healthcare infrastructure, adequate and equitable vaccine supplies, and higher sequencing capacity are essential for rapid and effective pandemic response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: India variant trends\n\n\n\n\nThe UK: Vaccine coverage, time to plan, and a coordinated response.\nThe Delta variant was first detected in the UK in February 2021. Between March 25 and April 7, 5.1% of travellers from India, 3.7% of those from Bangladesh, and 6.2% of those from Pakistan tested positive for Covid-19. In response, the government placed strict restrictions on travel from Pakistan and Bangladesh on April 9 and from India on April 23. Of those travellers who had been in these countries in the previous ten days, only UK citizens or legal residents were allowed entry, and they were subject to a mandatory ten-day quarantine and repeated testing for SARS-CoV-2. These policies presented the UK with additional time to gather data and prepare a response to the new variant. The backbone of an effective CovidOVID-19 response is widespread access to and uptake of effective vaccines. This is a top priority for resources and national programming. To protect the gains made in countries, such as the UK, where vaccination rates are high, near universal screening and sequencing of travelers with rigorous quarantine measures and contact tracing can help protect progress made. This suite of approaches will be critical to employ as variants emerge and spread worldwide.\nThe UK experience offers a positive example. The country has a robust sequencing program and recently introduced a new, cost-effective rapid genotyping assay, which has greatly increased the volume and speed of identification of variants, with a turnaround time of 12-24 hours, compared to 5-23 days for traditional sequencing techniques. Assuming the most recent two weeks of data is incomplete, data derived from GISAID indicates the UK has sequenced an average of 41% of its Covid-19 cases in the prior four weeks, with a median lag time of 10 days. Delta overcame Alpha as the predominant variant in May 2021, and a Delta-driven uptick in new cases has prompted a delay in lifting remaining Covid-19 social restrictions from June 21 to July 19, 2021. That time will be used to ramp up vaccinations. The Delta variant now accounts for 99% of sequenced cases and 97% of genotyped cases in the UK. The comprehensive nature of its sequencing program has allowed the UK to respond in a timely and tailored manner to evolving data on the ground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: UK variant trends\n\n\n\n\nThe US: National gaps in vaccine coverage and sequencing.\nSequencing has been less robust in the US. The Delta variant was first detected in the US in March 2021. Although its prevalence as of July 7, 2021 is lower in the US than the UK, its numbers are rising. Genomic surveillance in the US indicated that the Delta variant accounted for less than 1% of cases as of April 4, doubling approximately every two weeks and accounting for more than 51% of cases as of July 3. Just as the Alpha variant became the dominant lineage in the US in mid-March, in large part because it was more transmissible than the prevalent lineages at the time, the even more transmissible Delta variant is replacing Alpha. As scientists predicted, Delta has become the dominant lineagein the US. Parts of Missouri, Nevada, California, and Colorado are seeing Delta-related surges in Covid-19 cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: US variant trends\n\n\nThroughout 2020, laboratories in the US lacked the resources and infrastructure needed for effective genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants. In December 2020, the US ranked 43rd in the world, sequencing only 0.3% of samples. With increased federal funding and coordination, beginning in early 2021, the capacity and speed of genomic sequencing have ramped up, along with an increased scrutiny on the scope of data being made available to the public. In the United States as of June 2021, at least 33 states reported variant data publicly on a regular basis. Assuming incomplete data for the two weeks prior, data derived from GISAID on 6/28 indicates the US as a whole sequenced nearly 4.8% of its Covid-19 cases in the month of June, with a median lag time of 15 days. As of July 21, states’ median percent sequenced in the past 30 days ranged from 0% (South Dakota) to 13.28% (Nebraska) and the median lag time ranged from 7 days (Kansas and Nebraska) to 23 days (Delaware and Vermont), illustrating the differences in sequencing capacity between states. Although this is a slight improvement, US sequencing efforts are still insufficient to detect and monitor variants that emerge and circulate. Scientists have recommended sequencing between 5% to 30% of cases.\nAs of July 20, 2021, the Delta variant has been detected in 124 countries with a prevalence of over 75% in more than a dozen countries. Case numbers are expected to increase, especially in areas with low vaccination rates and insufficient genomic surveillance. With just 1% of people vaccinated, cases in Africa are doubling every 18 days, with Namibia, Uganda, Zambia, and South Africa most severely affected. Indonesia, Thailand, and South Korea are seeing record number of cases, and the Delta variant became dominant in Japan before the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony on July 23, prompting Olympic officials to ban all spectators. Parts of Australia are locking down due to Delta outbreaks.\n\n\n\nHow do scientists assess the danger posed by any given variant?\nAll variants, including Delta, are assessed for transmissibility, severity of disease, and ability to evade the immune system. In a Washington Post editorial, Dr. Ashish K. Jha, Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health called the Delta variant “one of the first triple threats across all those factors.” Studies have shown that the Delta variant is 40-60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, which is in turn 43-90% more transmissible than the original virus. The increased transmissibility of Delta may be related to a 1,000-fold increase in the amount of virus in the respiratory tract, compared to the original virus. Infection with the Delta variant is twice as likely as the Alpha variant to result in an ER visit or hospitalization. Reports out of Guangzhou, China suggest an increase in the severity of disease caused by the Delta variant. A study in the UK found that, as of June 23, 2021, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 in unvaccinated people are headache and runny nose, with shortness of breath and loss of the sense of smell being much rarer, ”indicating the symptoms as recorded previously are changing with the evolving variants of the virus.”\n\n\nHow do vaccines factor in?\nEvery variant of concern is evaluated to assess how well it is neutralized by antibodies from vaccinated individuals. Clinical studies assess how well vaccines perform against infection or disease caused by variants. So far, the information about vaccine-induced protection against variants has been reassuring for the people and places where vaccines are available. Fully vaccinated individuals mount a robust immune response that provides good protection against all known variants, including Delta. Those who have only received the first dose of a two-dose regimen, however, have reduced protection against the Delta variant compared to other known variants. Some studies show efficacy against symptomatic disease as low as 33% in singly vaccinated individuals, however studies also indicate around 75% vaccine effectiveness is maintained against hospitalization, even after only one dose. (Studies on the single-dose Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine are ongoing, and while some conflicting findings exist, early data showed promising results, especially against severe disease.) It is important to note that many differences exist in these studies, including methodological differences as well as the populations and vaccines involved, and additional clinical and laboratory studies are needed to provide a clearer picture.\nIn addition to the biological complexities emerging variants can create, improving vaccination rates remain a notable challenge. Worldwide, fifteen countries have more than 50% of residents fully vaccinated as of July 20. In the US, only 48.7% of the population is fully vaccinated as of July 20, but states range from 33.7% (Alabama) to 67% (Vermont). On a county-by-county basis, the variation in vaccination rates is even greater. This situation can lead to local pockets of increased transmission, resulting in more cases, more viral replication, and more opportunities for new mutations and new variants to emerge.\nThe immense and preventable delay in scaling global access to vaccinations is also the time window in which variants can continue to evolve. A new subtype derived from the Delta variant has already been detected in India, the UK, Portugal, and the US. Dubbed B.1.617.2.1, AY.1, or, more colloquially “Nepal Variant” or “Delta Plus,” it possesses an additional mutation (K417N) that is also present in the Beta variant. This mutation has been associated with an increased ability to evade the immune system. That mutation, combined with the increased transmissibility of Delta, has raised the concern of scientists and this virus subtype is being closely watched, although it has not yet been given a designation separate from the Delta VOC. Fortunately, it can be identified with the new rapid genotyping assay, which will aid in surveillance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Percent of new cases sequenced and submission lag per specimen collection week\n\n\n\n\nHow do surveillance and vaccination work together to curb the pandemic?\nGlobally, there is a wide range in the percent of positive Covid-19 samples that are sequenced; some countries sequence less than 0.01%, while some sequence more than 77%. The reasons for these disparities are many, including resources, technology, infrastructure, and policy decisions. There is no definitive way to predict where the next variant will emerge, and without ample sequencing, variants can become widespread before they are even detected. In addition, the lag time between obtaining a sample, determining its sequence, and reporting that data publicly needs to be shortened. A lag time of weeks, or even months, enables emerging variants to circulate widely before mitigation measures can be taken. It is also important to note that the samples chosen to sequence are rarely representative. Sampling bias can result from differences in sequencing capacity and lag times, as well as selective sampling during outbreaks and among travellers. Worldwide increases in sequencing capacity and speed are necessary for effective variant surveillance.\nThe best way to interrupt the transmission cycle is full vaccination, which protects those who are vaccinated, as well as unvaccinated or under-vaccinated members of their households and communities. Vaccination rates, like sequencing rates, vary widely between (and within) countries. Increasing those rates requires international cooperation. Countries, where variants are detected, should be helped, not stigmatized. A country with high testing, sequencing, and vaccination rates may be at an advantage, but it may only be temporary. If the rest of the world is not included in surveillance and vaccination efforts, there is little chance of ending the current pandemic or preventing the next one.\nAttention-grabbing headlines about variants may get more clicks and airtime, but they do little to promote public health and mitigate community risk. Detecting new or more widespread variants should trigger action, not panic. An outbreak should result in more testing and sequencing, as well as enhanced vaccination efforts and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masking and social restrictions on a personal and community level. Global cooperative surveillance and careful study of the properties of viral variants will provide the information we need to react in a fact-based rather than fear-based way to any new “supervirus.”\n\nWe are grateful to the data contributors who shared the data used in this Web Application via the GISAID Initiative1,2: the Authors, the Originating Laboratories responsible for obtaining the specimens, and the Submitting Laboratories that generated the genetic sequences and metadata.\nGISAID data provided on this website are subject to GISAID Terms and Conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nElbe, S., and Buckland-Merrett, G.

    "section": "",
    "text": "During the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, numerous variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged. Some have died out, and some have surged globally. They are all SARS-CoV-2, but they differ in important ways. Think of them as the boughs of the SARS-CoV-2 family tree, each of which has branched off into many smaller limbs. The smaller limbs have, in turn, branched off into even smaller twigs. Looked at from a distance, the SARS-CoV-2 tree may resemble a tangled tumbleweed, but scientists have used powerful genetic tools and bioinformatics to make sense of the viruses and trace how they are related.\nWhen a virus replicates, it makes copies of all of its genes. In the process, it makes mistakes, like typos in the string of 30,000 letters that make up the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Those mistakes may result in changes in the amino acids that make up a protein, altering its structure. Usually, those mistakes, or mutations, make no difference in how the virus functions or may even weaken the virus. Rarely, mutations may make the virus better able to cause disease, spread, or evade immunity. When a population of viruses with the same set of mutations is found in enough hosts, that group is labeled a variant. Going back to the tree analogy, think of variants as distinct branches.\nEvery time SARS-CoV-2 infects a person and replicates, mutations will occur. In the course of two years, there have been an unimaginable number of opportunities for mutations, with over 470 million documented infections, and likely many more undocumented infections. As long as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread, it will evolve and new variants will emerge. However, most of them will not end up causing global surges and won’t be any more of a threat than existing variants.\nBut what about variants carrying these rare mutations that make them more infectious or deadly? Researchers perform genomic surveillance on the virus to monitor its evolution in an effort to identify variants that may pose a threat. Variants that have the potential or demonstrated ability to be much more transmissible, immune evasive, or virulent are closely monitored and may be designated as variants of interest (VOIs), or variants of concern (VOCs). The World Health Organization has designated five variants as VOCs and given them the Greek letter names Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron.\n\nEach variant of concern is actually a population of related viruses.\nAlthough we talk about “the Delta variant” and “the Omicron variant” as if they were single entities, each is in fact made up of a population of many individual viruses with different patterns of mutations. Some of the mutations are important to the function of the virus. The rest usually don’t amount to much on a functional level, but they can be useful for tracing the transmission of viruses. For example, in an outbreak, the genetic sequences of viruses from infected people can help nail down the origin of the outbreak. It’s a viral version of the genetic tests people use to trace their ancestries, but researchers analyze the 30,000 RNA bases in the viral genome instead of the 3.4 billion DNA bases in the human genome.\n\n\nOrganizing and classifying SARS-CoV-2 viruses has become a huge undertaking.\nWhen researchers sequence samples of SARS-CoV-2, they may submit those sequences to public databases, such as GISAID or GenBank. Careful analysis of these sequences can reveal patterns and trends. Very early in the pandemic, this was a (relatively) simple task. As the pandemic progressed and millions of people became hosts for replicating viruses, the viruses accumulated more and more mutations. The result is a diverse viral population. By June 2020, there were more than 35,000 publicly available sequences, and it became clear that a method to organize and classify these viruses was needed. As of March 23, 2022, there were over 9.6 million sequences submitted to GISAID alone.\nSeveral commonly used naming systems classify the evolving forms of the virus, relying on rules determined by genomics experts to recognize the branches and twigs of the SARS-CoV-2 family tree. The terminology can differ between systems and in media reports, resulting in some confusion.\n\nA clade or lineage is a group of genetically similar viruses with a common ancestor.\nA sublineage is a group of similar viruses within a lineage.\nA subvariant is a sublineage of a variant, usually referring to a variant of concern.\n\nThe most widely used naming systems include Pango and Nextstrain. Although the major lineage and clade assignments correspond in general, systems may group viruses slightly differently, listing different specific mutations as being characteristic of the lineage or clade, for example. Mutations that are known or suspected to affect the variant’s ability to cause disease, spread, or evade immunity are more consistently included. (Unless stated otherwise, Pango lineages will be used here.) The WHO includes all of the sublineages of a lineage within its labels for variants of concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. SARS-CoV-2 Variants designated as Variants of Concern by the WHO are given Greek letter names. Other naming systems use different conventions.\n\n\nAs variants continue to evolve, they may acquire new mutations that have the potential to make them more of a threat. Variant sublineages are derived from variants by acquiring potentially significant additional mutations and these may evolve into genetically distinct forms of a variant that gain a competitive advantage and spread in a population. These subvariants may be monitored separately. The more opportunities a virus has to infect and replicate, the more mutations it will acquire, and the more sublineages it will propagate.\nSome mutations or groups of mutations are known to confer an increased ability to persist and spread, and have arisen independently in distinct lineages. In this convergent evolution, viruses with these traits are better able to multiply, and thus can outcompete lineages that do not have such advantages.\n\n\nAs the Delta variant circulated widely, it produced many subvariants.\nThe Delta variant, which was dominant worldwide between June and December 2021, has over 200 known sublineages. In the summer of 2021, a Delta subvariant, now called AY.1, was detected with an additional mutation that was associated with the ability to evade the immune system. More recently, another sublineage of Delta, called AY.4.2, was detected in at least 42 countries. It had three potentially worrisome mutations and began to increase in prevalence in some areas, although it did not reach very high levels worldwide.\nSublineages of the Delta variant are closely monitored, in part because the “next wave” was expected to arise from the Delta lineage. That expectation proved incorrect.\nWhen the Omicron variant was first sequenced in November 2021, it was found to have an astounding 50 mutations, compared to the original virus sequenced in January 2020. Moreover, genetic analysis revealed that the Omicron lineage had diverged from the other lineages sometime in mid-2020. The origins of such an unusual sequence continue to be a source of much speculation by scientists.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Chart of global SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC) growth from October 4, 2020 to March 21, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe Omicron variant consists of several major sublineages.\nSoon after its discovery, the Omicron variant was shown to have three quite distinct sublineages: BA.1, BA.2, and BA.3. They are, in fact, as different from each other, genetically, as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta are from each other. The highly transmissible BA.1 sublineage is the sublineage that spread so explosively worldwide. BA.1 is also known as B.1.1.529.1 or Nextstrain clade 21K. The BA.2 sublineage (also known as B.1.1.529.2 or Nextstrain clade 21L) appears to be even more transmissible than BA.1, which it has largely displaced. Another sublineage, BA.1.1, is derived from BA.1, and possesses an additional mutation (S:R345K) that may help it evade immunity. BA.1.1 has grown in prevalence in some areas. BA.2.2, a sublineage of BA.2 with an unusual spike mutation makes up the majority of Omicron samples in Hong Kong, and has also been detected in several other countries.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary tree diagram using Nextstrain data and adapted from the work of Dr. Emma Hodcroft. The distance between branches and twigs shows the differences in mutations between lineages and sublineages. This tree shows both Pango lineages and Nextstrain clades for Delta and Omicron where applicable.\n\n\n\n\nDiagnostic tests are different from sequencing, but some can identify possible variants.\nAn interesting feature of Omicron is known as S-Gene Dropout or S-Gene Target Failure (SGTF). Some PCR test kits are designed to detect parts of three different genes in SARS-CoV-2. The first sublineage of Omicron to become dominant globally, BA.1, is missing a part of the spike gene detected by this test, so it gives a negative result on one of the three parts of the test. (The Alpha variant also has this feature, but Alpha is rare now.) SGTF was a quick, inexpensive way to track the Omicron variant as it spread throughout the world. Unlike sequencing, which requires more specialized equipment and trained personnel, the SGTF feature allows diagnostic laboratories to detect possible Omicron cases.\nBut Omicron’s evolution added a wrinkle. The BA.2 sublineage cannot be tracked using SGTF, since it is not missing the part of the spike gene that gives a negative result. This was not a problem at first, since BA.1 was dominant, but as BA.2 began showing up more frequently, SGTF became less useful. Often misleadingly called the “Stealth Variant” because it lacked the SGTF feature, it is still detected by diagnostic PCR, but cannot be identified as Omicron without sequencing.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Global Omicron sublineage growth. BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.3 all display S-gene target failure (SGTF). SGTF is a characteristic allowing for rapid detection of probable BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.3 Omicron (and previously the Alpha variant). BA.2 does not display SGTF, leading to it being dubbed the “Stealth Variant.”\n\n\n\n\nThe properties of a lineage or sublineage depend on its pattern of mutations.\nEach unique combination of mutations in a variant or subvariant may endow it with different properties. Researchers can make predictions based on past epidemiological or laboratory studies but new, unknown mutations, or mutations in new combinations need to be studied to determine their abilities to infect, replicate, and cause disease. This can be a complex matter, and it becomes more complex with each wave of variants that appears. Teasing out a virus’s inherent virulence or transmissibility from its ability to evade the immune response is especially difficult. The ability of a lineage to avoid the immune system depends on the properties of the virus itself, as well as a person’s immune status, including:\n\nIf a person is immunocompromised\nIf immunity was induced by a vaccine, or infection, or both\nThe vaccine type and number of doses\nThe variant responsible for a previous infection\n\nThere is also the question of the effectiveness of therapeutic treatments. Monoclonal antibody treatments can be quite effective if they are directed at a susceptible virus. Mutations that change the viral structure—especially the spike protein— can render a previously effective treatment useless. Many of the monoclonal antibody treatments that are effective against the Delta variant, for example, are ineffective against the BA.1 sublineage of Omicron. Unfortunately, sotrovimab, which retains some activity against BA.1, appears to be much less effective against the BA.2 sublineage of Omicron. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized a new monoclonal antibody called bebtelovimab, which appears to be effective against the BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2 subvariants of Omicron.\nEvusheld, a long-acting antibody combination therapy given to prevent COVID-19 in immunocompromised individuals, may be less effective against BA.1 and BA.1.1, and the FDA has authorized an increased dose. Fortunately, laboratory studies suggest Evusheld may retain its effectiveness against BA.2.\nAntivirals that are not based on antibodies, such as Remdesivir and Paxlovid, target parts of the virus that are more stable, and thus less likely to be affected by the genetic changes in variants and subvariants. Remdesivir, Molnupiravir, and Nirmatrelvir have been shown to retain their effectiveness against BA.2 in the laboratory.\n\n\nRecombination is still rare, but possible.\nAnother way viruses can generate diversity is through recombination, which happens when two different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 infect the same cell. Two different genomes can then swap out sections, a process that is quite distinct from the errors that cause mutations. Recombination is more likely to happen—and to be detected—when two different variants are circulating at high levels at the same time, such as when Omicron replaced Delta as the dominant variant. Early reports of a recombination event between Delta and Omicron were found to be a laboratory artifact, demonstrating the challenge of accurately detecting recombinants.\nMore recently, strong evidence of such recombinant viruses has been reported. Sometimes called “Deltacron” in media reports, one recombinant virus, first identified in France, has a spike derived from the BA.1 sublineage of Omicron on a background derived from the AY.4.2 sublineage of Delta. Pango has assigned this recombinant to a lineage called XD and the WHO has designated it a Variant Under Monitoring. Another recombinant between BA.1 and Delta, first described in the UK, has been dubbed XF. A recombinant between the BA.1 and BA.2 sublineages of Omicron has been reported in the UK and assigned the Pango lineage XE. Recombinants have also been reported in the Netherlands, Denmark, and the US. While there is no evidence that the recombinant viruses are much of a public health threat, they are being watched closely.\n\n\nAs the virus evolves, it must be monitored.\nThe lack of an SGTF feature in the BA.2 sublineage of Omicron and the presence of recombinants illustrate the problem with reliance on short, characteristic sequences to identify variants. While PCR tests designed to detect variant-specific parts of viral RNA are quicker and more cost-effective than sequencing the whole genome, the constant evolution of the virus, through mutation and recombination, can interfere with the process. This is especially true when levels of community transmission are high. PCR tests recognize very small parts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Mutations or recombination events in those short sequences can alter test results. Moreover, by focusing only on those short sequences to identify variants, changes in the rest of the genome are overlooked. While mutations in the spike protein are important for virus binding to host cells and immune evasion, mutations elsewhere in the genome can have profound effects on viral functions.\nAlthough it is impossible to predict when and where the next major variant will arise, there will be more variants. Whether they evolve from known variants or arise independently, it is imperative to detect them as quickly as possible. Whole genome sequencing is the gold standard for identifying variants and subvariants. There are, however, many parts of the world where sequencing capacity is limited. These “sequencing deserts” are places where new, possibly more dangerous variants, like Omicron, can emerge and spread undetected. Until widespread sequencing of representative samples is in place, the world is vulnerable to the emergence of more variants or subvariants. A robust global system of genomic surveillance can help put an end to the current pandemic and prevent the next one."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today, we are releasing a reporting scorecard that evaluates US state data reporting for Covid-19 breakthrough infections (BI) against best practices we have identified.1 We assign states letter grades based on their alignment with these best practices for reporting BI data.2 The scorecard with states’ grades, as well as breakdowns of the criteria they meet, will be updated regularly. You can find it here.1 While we use the term “breakthrough infections data” as a shorthand for data about Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths after vaccination, it is important to remember that data does not reflect all post-vaccination infections because of limited testing.2 We use “states” as a shorthand term for both states and territories.\nWe are launching this scorecard because of the lack of high-quality breakthrough data in the United States. While the CDC shares some helpful information on breakthrough rates, that information is challenging to aggregate on a nationwide scale; as a result, it is updated infrequently and cannot be broken down by state. State-provided BI data is faster and more granular than federal data, but like with other state Covid-19 metrics, also highly incomplete and unstandardized. The ability to see local, fast-updating data on breakthrough infections is critical to effective pandemic response. We hope the scorecard will encourage states to share more and higher-quality BI data in support of that mission.\n\nWhat we’re grading\nOur scorecard evaluates public BI data reporting for all 50 states, as well as Washington DC and Puerto Rico (we exclude any US jurisdiction with a population of less than 500,000). We assign states whole letter grades A through F; if states meet every criteria we have identified, they can earn an A+. This letter grade solely reflects states’ alignment with BI reporting best practices and does not evaluate how well a state is responding to Covid-19 overall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Scorecard grades and their meanings\n\n\nWe break down best practices for reporting into two categories: data reporting, which addresses what states are sharing, and data presentation, addressing how they are sharing it. These criteria will be regularly reviewed to ensure they reflect the most pressing priorities for data on breakthrough infections—for example, we may begin tracking reporting on infections after third doses. Here’s a summary of the criteria we are including in each category right now and why they are important. You can find the details of how they are evaluated on the scorecard page.\nData Reporting\n\nProviding cumulative breakthrough cases, breakthrough hospitalizations, breakthrough deaths, and vaccinations: When a state can produce these cumulative counts, it indicates the data reporting systems it uses to produce vaccination status breakdowns are in good order.\nProviding cumulative percentages of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals: These percentages are important for public communication about the absolute and relative risk of Covid-19 infection, hospitalization, or death in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.\nProviding time series of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in vaccinated and unvaccinated people: Case, hospitalization, and deaths data by vaccination status over time are perhaps the most important breakthrough data for both public and policymakers alike—they allow for tracking absolute and relative changes in the incidence and severity of breakthrough Covid-19 infections.\n\nAs with cumulative data, states can report time series data either as raw numbers of outcomes in vaccinated/unvaccinated population and the number of people in that population, or as rates dividing those two numbers. But rates can be calculated in many different ways, so without access to underlying data, they can be impossible to replicate or interpret. For that reason, for a state to get full credit for a time series, states had to report both a rate and all underlying data that went into that rate (i.e. number vaccinated over time and number of breakthrough cases over time).\n\nData Presentation\n\nProviding definitions for breakthrough cases, breakthrough hospitalizations, breakthrough deaths, vaccinations, and rates: Not all states define their Covid-19 metrics the same way, so it is important for states to provide definitions of all metrics.\nMaking downloadable data available: Providing data through an API or downloadable CSVs increases transparency and enables researchers to use it in their own analysis.\nRegularly reporting data: Because timely data is important for understanding trends, states that do not share data at least monthly automatically receive an F.\n\n\n\nWhat we found\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Currently, nine states receive an F grade because they do not share data regularly. Of the remaining states, three (California, Colorado, and Utah) meet the criteria for an A.\n\n\nOur analysis of state reporting found that most states are now reporting breakthrough data—with 43 out of 52 juridictions now regularly sharing data, up from just over half that in the summer. Those states almost all report important cumulative counts of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. The majority of those states also report time-series data, with 34 states reporting at least one metric over time.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Including states with both regular and ad hoc public reports, as of December 16, 2021, 40 states have reported cumulative breakthrough cases, 37 states have reported cumulative breakthrough hospitalizations, and 42 states have reported cumulative breakthrough deaths.\n\n\n\nThat so many states are reporting data is impressive given the uphill battle that state health departments have faced in collecting breakthrough data. Over the past decades, state health departments have been chronically underfunded, resulting in out-of-date, badly-maintained data systems for infectious disease surveillance. When we reached out to states to confirm we had correctly assessed their reporting, some shared that they do not have the resources to compile regular updates. To regularly capture, link, and publish this critical data, states need federal support, like that provided through the CDC’s Data Modernization Initiative or upcoming data infrastructure projects under the American Rescue Plan.\nEven given infrastructural obstacles, one easy way many states could improve their grades is by making downloads available of all the data underlying their time series—data they must already have to produce their rates. While 34 states report at least one of incidence, hospitalization or mortality rates by vaccination status over time, only three states make underlying data available for all the rates they report, and only six states make any data downloadable. \nCurrently, only three states meet the standard for an A; if states made underlying data downloads available for all the rates they are already reporting, 20 states would receive this grade.\n\n\nWhy it matters\nThroughout our experience collecting Covid-19 data, we have seen time and again that providing consistent, interpretable, high quality data earns the trust of the public. BI data shows the clear trend that Covid-19 hospitalization and deaths are largely concentrated in unvaccinated individuals. Sharing that data is a critical part in overcoming vaccine hesitancy.\nBreakthrough data has other urgent policy implications: It provides crucial early warning signals for possible changes in transmission, vaccine-conferred immunity, and disease dynamics. To understand the risk that vaccinated individuals face from variants like Delta and Omicron—and to assess impact on vaccine effectiveness of any new variants that may emerge—we need access to timely and local breakthrough data that states can provide.\nWorking with very little, over the past two years, state health officials have pulled off superhuman feats to share critical Covid-19 data with the public. We hope they will continue their track record of exemplary public service by improving Covid-19 breakthrough data so that it is more transparent, standardized, and actionable."

    "title": "Tackling the Complexities of Covid-19 Wastewater Surveillance",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For more than two years, data derived from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid antigen tests on nasal swabs from individuals has been the primary source of data on Covid-19 in communities. As clinical testing data is becoming less reliably available, wastewater surveillance has emerged as a valuable epidemiological tool. It can detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in a community and monitor trends over time. Because wastewater monitoring does not rely on access to individual diagnostics, it can provide insights that are essential for controlling the current Covid-19 pandemic and preventing future pandemics.\nThere are many advantages to wastewater as a source of data. However, as with clinical data such as cases and hospitalizations, wastewater data generated from multiple sources can calculate and report data differently. Analysis of wastewater can use some of the same assays as those used in clinical laboratories, but there are additional steps in the process. Methodological choices at each step—the time and place for sampling, the particular PCR assay, the way the results are reported, for example—introduce variation that can affect the accuracy and interpretation of the data.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Wastewater monitoring is a process that requires multiple steps to collect, process, and analyze samples and report data.\n\n\n\n1. Sampling: Where and When\nUnlike clinical samples, which are collected from individuals, a wastewater sample is a pool of samples from many people. Samples collected at a wastewater treatment facility contain waste from the entire population of the area served by that facility. Samples collected from smaller areas, such as from individual buildings or neighborhoods, can provide more granular data, but as the population sampled becomes smaller, privacy and representation concerns become more important and data becomes more variable and difficult to interpret. Weekly sampling may be adequate to detect the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater when community transmission levels are low. More frequent sampling of a larger number of sites can more accurately identify trends, but requires a larger investment of time and resources.\n\n\n2. Sampling: How\nA sample of liquid wastewater taken at a single timepoint (grab sampling) can provide a snapshot of viral content in wastewater, but can be inconsistent, as wastewater flow fluctuates over the course of a day. Collection over a longer period of time (e.g., 24 hours) can be accomplished by taking samples periodically (automatic composite sampling) or by immersing a material such as cotton gauze into the wastewater flow (passive sampling).\nAnalysis can also be performed on the solids that settle out of wastewater. Levels of SARS-CoV-2 tend to be higher in the solid portion than in unseparated liquid wastewater.\n\n\n3. Transportation and Storage\nThe information that can be gleaned from wastewater depends on the quality of the sample, which can be affected by conditions to which it is exposed, even before it reaches the laboratory. A fraction of the viral RNA can degrade in the time it takes to travel from an infected individual to the sampling site, and then to the laboratory. Time spent above refrigerator temperature will degrade sample quality, as will repeated freeze-thaw cycles. A degraded sample may yield misleadingly low results. Conversely, cross-contamination of samples, containers, or equipment could cause false positives in sensitive assays such as PCR without the rigorous quality controls in place in most laboratories.\n\n\n4. Sample Preparation\nThe composition of wastewater is quite different from the material collected in a nasal swab, and additional processing is needed before the sample can be analyzed. The many different laboratory methods can introduce sources of error that are accounted for with appropriate quality control protocols. Pretreatment may include removal of solids or addition of chemicals to adjust the pH or salinity. Viruses from liquid wastewater samples are typically concentrated by one of many methods. The viral RNA is extracted from the sample,converted to DNA, and analyzed by PCR.\n\n\n5. Analysis\nPCR is the gold standard for detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples, as well as in wastewater. In clinical samples, all that is needed for a diagnosis is to know if the virus is present or not. In wastewater, however, the goal is often to determine how much viral RNA is present. Different kinds of PCR can yield different results.\n\nIn quantitative PCR (qPCR), the amount of specific RNA in a sample is inferred by the strength of the signal produced by the fluorescent dyes in the reaction, or by the number of PCR cycles required for the signal to become detectable (the cycle threshold).\nDigital PCR (dPCR) is a more accurate way to measure RNA levels. Instead of determining the amount of RNA in an entire sample, the sample is partitioned into thousands of individual compartments or—in the case of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)—droplets, each of which acts as its own reaction vessel.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: In quantitative PCR, the signal is detected over the course of the amplification process. The more of the target sequence present in the original sample, the quicker the signal will reach the detection threshold. In digital PCR, the sample is separated into thousands of separate amplification reactions, each of which results in either a positive or negative signal at the endpoint.\n\n\nOne of the most important choices in developing PCR for wastewater analysis is selecting which sequences within the dozen or so SARS-CoV-2 genes to target. The specificity of a PCR assay is determined by the sequence of the primers, short stretches of DNA that correspond to parts of the target gene. The choice of target sequences and primers can vary between laboratories and, depending on the evolution of the virus, may need to be changed.\n\nPrimers specific for conserved (i.e., less likely to mutate) portions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome can detect and quantify the total level of virus in the wastewater sample. These primers are most often specific for the gene encoding the nucleocapsid (a protein in the virus interior).\nPrimers specific to portions of the genome that are characteristic of known variants (usually in the spike, a surface protein) may indicate the presence of specific variants and their relative proportion in a wastewater sample.\n\nWhile PCR can suggest the presence and proportion of different viral variants, sequencing is required for definitive identification. High-throughput sequencing can give a broader picture of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Variants of SARS-CoV-2 possess characteristic patterns of mutations, and many of them are outside of the areas detected by PCR. Since the viral RNA in wastewater consists of a mixture of fragments from many different viruses from many different individuals, sequences obtained from wastewater can identify mutations, but it can be difficult to definitively determine if those mutations are present on the same genome. When mutations characteristic of specific variants are identified in wastewater, however, that information can guide public health officials in obtaining clinical samples from individuals in the area for whole genome sequencing.\nAny laboratory assay needs positive and negative controls, but analysis of wastewater samples needs additional controls.\n\nA matrix recovery control consists of a known amount of a similar, but distinct virus (e.g., mouse or bovine coronaviruses) added to the sample at the beginning to assess how much of the viral RNA is lost during processing.\nSince the concentration of wastewater samples can vary, human fecal normalization can account for such differences by measuring the amount of something that is present in large amounts in human feces, such as pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and comparing it to the amount of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThese controls can help validate results and detect errors or problems with analytical methods.\n\n\n6. Reporting\nOnce raw data is obtained, it needs to be reported in meaningful ways. Many local jurisdictions post wastewater data on online dashboards, but only a handful of states do so.\n\nBecause the wastewater in a particular sample may represent a wide range of populations, and because populations in a location can vary over time (due to tourism, for example), some jurisdictions, including Oregon, Utah, and Wisconsin express their results on a per capita basis. Although Missouri’s dashboard displays its results in copies/day, it does provide the population for each location, allowing a more meaningful interpretation of the data.\nMany states report wastewater data based on the volume of the sample including Colorado (copies per liter) and Michigan (copies per 100 milliliters).\nThe rate of flow, and volume of wastewater in a sampling site may change over time, with increased rainfall, for example, or in industrial locations. To account for such variation, Ohio and North Carolina use “flow normalized” values to report copies per capita.\nOther ways to express data include as copies per gram (when wastewater solids are analyzed) or as a ratio of viral genes to PPMoV (normalized for human fecal content).\nWhen a dashboard aggregates data from multiple locations with different ways of reporting data (with different units), SARS-CoV-2 levels may be expressed as “intensity” or “concentration,” but without units.\nOn a global basis, one study identified 96 different ways viral levels have been expressed on dashboards. The authors urge consensus on methods of calculating and reporting viral concentrations in wastewater.\n\nBiobot Analytics, which provides wastewater analysis for more than 150 counties in 47 states and territories, proposes a metric called “effective concentration” to account for the variables inherent in wastewater analysis. This metric takes into account:\n\nWastewater concentration\nPopulation represented by the sample\nSewage flow rate\nRNA degradation\nReaction inhibition by contaminants in wastewater\nHuman fecal strength normalization with PPMoV\n\nNo matter how the results of quantitative assays are reported, it is still not possible at this time to determine how many infected individuals are represented by the data. The amount, frequency, and duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in feces is quite variable, and may differ depending on the infecting variant. It is therefore impossible to tell if the amount of virus in wastewater is due to a few people shedding a lot of virus or a lot of people shedding a little virus. Wastewater surveillance is a complement to clinical data, not a replacement.\n\n\nThe bigger picture\nIdeally, every community with the capacity to monitor wastewater would use the same methods to allow for meaningful comparisons. As it stands currently, lack of standardization in methods and reporting makes it impossible to compare results from different jurisdictions. Within jurisdictions, trends over time are more likely to be accurate, as long as methods remain the same. Trends are, after all, meaningful ways to interpret wastewater data to inform public health decisions. Some form of trend metric is included in most public wastewater reporting.\nBecause of the potential variability introduced at each step in wastewater processing and analysis, it is important that data about the samples and methodology accompany the reported results.\n\nMany states receive data from jurisdictions using different methods. California’s wastewater dashboard, for example, lists the laboratory or laboratories providing data for each location, and the units used to report SARS-CoV-2 levels.\nMichigan’s dashboard displays the sample type (grab or composite) and PCR type (qPCR or ddPCR) and laboratory performing analysis for each location.\nWisconsin and Minnesota note sites where laboratories have changed their analytical methods, and caution that values before and after the change should not be compared.\n\nIn February 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) launched a dashboard to display wastewater data provided voluntarily by communities across the US. Inconsistencies in methods and reporting by these 800-1,000 sites can limit the utility of such an aggregated site, but the CDC is continuing to refine their metrics and reporting. In May 2022 NWSS partnered with Biobot Analytics to collect and analyze wastewater samples from 500 US communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: US counties with SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring. Coverage is growing, but many counties and some states and territories still lack wastewater monitoring.\n\n\nWhile the CDC’s NWSS site currently displays only trends in virus levels in wastewater, sequencing of viral RNA is essential for tracking variants in communities able to perform that analysis, Early detection of new variants in a community can track the introduction and geographic spread of variants. Expansion of sequencing capacity would help improve genomic surveillance of both clinical and wastewater samples. As with quantitative analysis, genomic analysis would benefit from standardization. CDC is working with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to establish a wastewater sequencing database.\nIn early May 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced a genomic sequencing project to provide wastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on its well-established GenomeTrakr Network for monitoring foodborne pathogens, the program has so far submitted approximately 1,200 samples, from ten states, to NCBI’s public database. The FDA effort is geographically limited, and while CDC works on a sequencing database, there is currently no national or global platform for wastewater sequences. As a result, researchers and policymakers are left with the task of reaching out and communicating wastewater data.\nGenomeTrakr had been monitoring water leaving wastewater treatment plants (effluent) for foodborne pathogens (used for use in agriculture or seafood beds, for example). New methods had to be developed to analyze wastewater coming into treatment plants (influent) for SARS-CoV-2. Numerous detailed protocols are provided for all of the steps in the wastewater sequencing process, including sampling, concentration, RNA extraction, qPCR, genome sequencing, and quality controls. Established with funding from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, these efforts will continue as long as funds are available.\nWastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 is not limited to the United States. Several groups are working to enhance collaboration on gathering and aggregating wastewater data. These include:\n\nWastewater SPHERE (SARS Public Health Environmental REsponse)\nCovidPoops19 at UC-Merced\nThe NSF Research Coordination Network (RCN)\nSewage Analysis CORe group Europe (SCORE)\nEU Sewage Sentinel System for SARS-CoV-2\n\n\n\nThe way forward\nAlthough standardized methods are ideal, localities must often use the methods that meet their own criteria of accuracy, sensitivity, cost, time, supply chain, and laboratory capacity. Public health priorities may differ in different geographic areas, or at different levels of community transmission, requiring individualized sampling procedures and laboratory methods. When community levels are low, for example, the goal of surveillance might be to detect a resurgence in levels. College campuses may prefer sampling individual buildings to detect outbreaks in dormitories. In areas with high levels of population movement, detection of variants may be the goal. Multiple standardized methods would allow for flexibility depending on the needs of the community.\nWastewater surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 has made extraordinary scientific and technical progress over the course of the pandemic. Methods are currently undergoing a great deal of scrutiny and refinement. It is also likely that methods may need to change due to changes in epidemiological conditions and technical and scientific advances. The numerous innovations in wastewater surveillance during the Covid-19 pandemic can benefit other fields, including environmental surveillance for other pathogens, especially those resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Such innovations may help the FDA’s GenomeTrakr Network, for example, improve monitoring of foodborne pathogens by eliminating the need for growing pathogens in pure culture in the laboratory.\nThe work done to develop wastewater monitoring methods has revealed a great deal of complexity. Building on this foundation, wastewater surveillance networks encompassing academia, industry, and government can aim for a more unified system or set of systems. As wastewater monitoring methods continue to improve, and methods become more standardized, wastewater data can be a valuable asset to inform public health action. The examples cited here have just skimmed the surface of the complexities and range of practices in wastewater surveillance in the US. Most of the issues raised apply on a global level, with additional issues associated with low-resource settings and non-centralized wastewater management such as septic tanks, latrines, and open sewage drains.\nPublic health agencies in the US are likely to continue to use wastewater surveillance even after the Covid-19 pandemic subsides. Expansion of wastewater monitoring will require adequate funding, collaboration, transparency, and trust, in addition to accessible technology. Along with increased surveillance capacity, improved data quality can help detect and mitigate future disease outbreaks before they can become pandemics."

Shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as well as many state, territorial, and local health departments, rates broken down by vaccination status provide a useful way to compare vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals’ relative risk, assess an individual’s absolute risk, and understand how vaccines are faring over time against challenges like new variants.\nYet with any Covid-19 metric, even apparently simple, straightforward calculations can hide surprising complexity; vaccine breakthrough rates are no exception to that trend. While the CDC shares standardized rates data aggregated from up to 29 US jurisdictions representing 67% of the US total population, it does not provide breakdowns of this data by state and territory. As a result, getting more granular data requires turning to a patchwork of state and territorial data sources, for which, even among those jurisdictions publishing their data, consistency is hard to come by.\nIn this post, we’ll be giving you a guide to interpreting Covid-19 breakthrough rates offered by the CDC, state, and territorial governments—data which can be both very useful when used properly and very difficult to interpret in light of definitional inconsistencies across jurisdictions."

    "text": "What is a breakthrough rate?\n\nAnatomy of a rate\nBefore diving into the complexities of breakthrough rates, it’s worth reviewing what rates are in public health and epidemiology and why they are so useful. Rates in this piece refer to the number of events or outcomes of interest that occur per person in the population susceptible to that event or outcome, over a specified time period (this could be granular, like daily or weekly, but also could be cumulative across the course of the pandemic).\n\n\nThis calculation will tell you the proportion of individuals, in the specified population, that the event has occurred in over the specified time period. If the rate is less than one, that means the event has not happened to every single person in the population over the time period in question. For example, in a population with a 0.5 per capita rate of a given event, we would expect one out of every two people in that population to have experienced that event within the time period.\nRates are so useful because they provide a way of understanding and comparing the frequency of events across populations of different sizes, like Wyoming’s and California’s. By dividing the number of cases in each state by the total population, we can control for those different population sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. 7-day average of Covid-19 cases on February 23, 2022 in California and Wyoming. California has a population nearly 70 times that of Wyoming’s, and had 10,123 cases to Wyoming’s 142 cases. However, California’s rate per 100,000 was 25.6, while Wyoming’s was close at 24.6, highlighting that counts without rates can obscure trends in the data."

    "text": "Vaccine breakthrough rates\nIn the context of vaccine breakthrough data, rates serve a very similar purpose as they do in comparisons across states: they let us fairly compare Covid-19 statistics across differently-sized populations. But instead of state populations, the populations in question for vaccine breakthrough rates are those of vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated individuals.\n\nBreakthrough rates are calculated for a specific time period, in a specific region. Almost all states that report breakthrough data will perform the analogous calculation for the unvaccinated population to compare with vaccine breakthrough rates.\nSince August 2021, the fully vaccinated population has outnumbered the unvaccinated population in the United States. Just as California’s raw case counts are higher than Wyoming’s because California has more residents than Wyoming,** raw counts of vaccine breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, or deaths may look high in comparison to unvaccinated counts just because vaccinated people outnumber unvaccinated people**. Using rates per 100,000 individuals lets us control for those population differences and make a fairer comparison. In the CDC’s data, for example, taking a rate of cases demonstrates there is a larger gap in Covid-19 incidence between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations than the raw counts might imply.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A sequence of illustrative examples showing how raw counts of cases in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated are misleading and can be calculated into rates per 100k and rate ratios for more appropriate population-adjusted comparison\n\n\nUnlike state populations, which are relatively stable over the time frame of interest, the size of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations constantly change as more individuals get vaccinated. That makes calculating rates by vaccination status more data-intensive than calculating other Covid-19 rates. Taking a vaccine breakthrough case rate over time requires a well-defined time series for both the numerator of cases in vaccinated individuals and** for the denominator—the growing size of the vaccinated population.**\nHow states find these population totals can have a big impact on the rates they calculate. Over- or under-estimating the unvaccinated population by using out-of-date or improperly-estimated data can result in erroneous summary figures and require corrections that will be examined below."

    "text": "Rate ratios and vaccine effectiveness\nBy comparing rates of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths broken down by vaccination status, we can get a picture of the differences in disease incidence and severe disease between these two populations. Rates by vaccine status allow us to calculate metrics that quantify important metrics, like rate ratios and vaccine effectiveness.\nRate ratios (RRs) capture how many more times Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths occur in unvaccinated individuals than vaccinated individuals. For example, if the outcome of interest is cases:\n\nSince vaccinations are expected to reduce the risk of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths across the board, the rate ratios are almost always numbers greater than one, meaning a person who is unvaccinated is at higher risk than one who is not. The rate ratio is a metric often highlighted on state dashboards as well as by the CDC COVID data tracker. The rate ratio number (and definition of what populations are being compared) is often summarized in headlines as an “X” multiple; for example, the CDC page states that “unvaccinated people aged 5 years and older had 2.8X risk of testing positive for COVID-19 in February, compared to people vaccinated with at least a primary series.”\nVaccine effectiveness (VE) is the real-world counterpart measure to vaccine efficacy, which is used in controlled trials to quantify the protective effect of vaccines against Covid-19 cases and severe outcomes. VE measures how much vaccination reduces_ _the number of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths. One way of finding this value is (where RR represents the rate ratio as shown above):\n\nBy comparing population-level rates, VE measures the relative risk of an outcome in a vaccinated group compared to an unvaccinated group of similar makeup. For example, a vaccine effectiveness of 65% against infection means there were 65% fewer cases in a group of vaccinated individuals compared to a similar group that is unvaccinated.\nBecause both RR and VE depend on rates, they can be affected by the different methodological choices states make in their data definitions and rate calculations."

    "section": "How do states calculate vaccine breakthrough rates?",
    "text": "How do states calculate vaccine breakthrough rates?\nIn the absence of federal standards for public Covid-19 data reporting, states and territories make inconsistent choices about the definitions and methodologies used when calculating rates.\n\nStates make different choices when they define populations of “vaccinated” and “unvaccinated” individuals that comprise rates’ denominators.\nSome states use age adjustment methodologies on top of their rate calculations to control for different age distributions among vaccinated and unvaccinated populations while other states do not age-adjust their rates.\n\nThese discrepancies in definitions and methodologies can make large differences in the value of the rates.\n\nPopulation definitions\nCovid-19 vaccination is not a single, clear-cut event that neatly segments the population into vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. To ascertain individuals’ vaccination status, states have to track them across different doses, and across variable numbers of doses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2. Depending on the vaccine product and other situations, an individual in the US could receive up to 5 vaccine doses.\n\n\nAs a result of this ambiguity, methods for breaking down the population into comparison groups have varied across jurisdictions. Some details of vaccinated and unvaccinated population definitions are too poorly documented to understand how states are handling them. For example, states may not explicitly address how they handle the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and no state addresses how they count additional doses for immunocompromised individuals, who comprise at least 2.7% of the US adult population—or about 7 million people. But with what documentation states do provide, we can observe two major differences in definitions of populations across states, both of which appear to have a large effect on their rates:\n\nWhether or not states include partially vaccinated individuals (with one dose of a two-dose primary series for mRNA vaccines) in their “unvaccinated” populations.\nWhether states are separating out boosted individuals in their “vaccinated” populations.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure 2. 23 states report rates as a time series, but they use different definitions of the “unvaccinated” population denominator. Some lump in partially vaccinated individuals, while others exclude those partially vaccinated or split them out into a separate comparison group.\n\n\n\n\nAre partially vaccinated individuals included in the “unvaccinated” population?\nOf the 23 states that report vaccine breakthrough rate over time, at least 14 states appear to include partially vaccinated individuals in their “unvaccinated” populations, while nine states appear to exclude partially vaccinated individuals from their “unvaccinated” populations (Virginia is the only state that separates “partially vaccinated” into a separate group). Six of these states did not define denominators in detail, so assumptions were made to determine how their unvaccinated populations are defined.\nStates that include partially vaccinated individuals may appear to have lower rates of cases in their unvaccinated populations than states that exclude partially vaccinated individuals. In turn, these states may appear to have lower RRs and VEs than states excluding partially vaccinated individuals. This is especially true when the share of partially vaccinated is high, whether because many individuals have not completed their primary series or because of a recent uptick in vaccinations. The inclusion or exclusion of partially vaccinated individuals in the unvaccinated population is a critical piece of information for understanding and comparing the metrics reported by states and is one of the criteria in the Pandemic Prevention Institute’s Vaccine Breakthrough Reporting Scorecard.\nThe decision to include or exclude partially vaccinated individuals can make a big difference to unvaccinated rates, and in turn RR and VE calculations. For example, on its dashboard, Virginia breaks out rates and RRs by fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and unvaccinated populations. Its data demonstrates a large difference in rates between unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals. Data from other states, like New York, supports this observation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3. Covid-19 case rates in Virginia for week ending March 26, 2022. The data indicates that unvaccinated people developed Covid-19 at a rate 6.7x that of fully vaccinated people and 3x that of partially vaccinated people.\n\n\n\n\nAre boosted individuals included in the “vaccinated” population?\nEffectiveness of the primary vaccine series against infection—and (to a lesser degree) against severe disease and death—wanes over time, especially with Omicron being the dominant circulating variant. Booster doses can provide additional protection, but also introduce additional complexity. Just as combining partially vaccinated and unvaccinated populations can obscure key differences between the two populations, combining boosted populations with those who have completed their primary series into a single “vaccinated” population can obscure important trends. Data from states, like California, that separate out these two categories demonstrates large differences between these two populations.\nCurrently, only 11 states out of the 23 that provide time series of vaccine breakthrough rates break down their fully vaccinated rates into categories of those who received their primary series and those who have received their booster; all other states that report a time series either combine the two categories or don’t provide clear data definitions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: 11 states reporting vaccine breakthrough rates data distinguish in their “vaccinated” group between those vaccinated with a primary series of doses only and those who have received an additional/booster dose.\n\n\n\n\nConnecting vaccination data\nDocumenting breakthrough cases requires connecting clinical information (testing, hospitalization, and deaths) with the complete vaccination record of that individual. Errors in connecting data can result in the misclassification of cases. For example:\n\nIf the vaccination status of a vaccinated person who contracts Covid-19 is unknown or unrecorded, that individual may be incorrectly classified as unvaccinated and therefore a non-breakthrough case.\nIf an individual’s second or third vaccine dose is not connected to previous doses, that vaccination may be misclassified as a first dose.\n\nSimply determining which individuals represent breakthrough cases can be an administrative quagmire; case and vaccination datasets are usually housed in different data systems. Most states have a centralized immunization information system (IIS) containing vaccination data, which will often not contain information on individuals vaccinated through federal and other supplemental systems. The records in IIS must then be cross-referenced with one or more complementary data systems that contain case information, often done through an automated system. The information states use to connect data (the individual’s name, date of birth, and address, for example) may vary—as does how closely the data has to align in order to be considered a match.\nIn Texas, for instance, only exact matches between case data and vaccination records for first name, last name, and date of birth will be considered a breakthrough case. While some states also incorporate cases matched by hand by local health departments or other interviewers, if a breakthrough case cannot be correctly identified, it will usually be misclassified as a non-breakthrough case. Because these misclassifications reduce the number of breakthrough cases that can be counted, they may artificially reduce the breakthrough rate and increase the unvaccinated rate, leading to an inflated RR and VE calculation for a given population. Given how frequently this kind of error occurs in more general situations, this kind of distortion represents a real challenge for incompatible data systems.\nThe CDC and some states like Washington have introduced methods to account for measurement errors that overestimate how many people have been vaccinated. Difficulty correctly matching booster doses to their initial series can lead to third doses inadvertently being classified as first doses, leading to the impossible figure of over 100% of people in a given age range having received their first dose. Likewise, difficulty determining the correct population figures used to calculate rates—for instance, due to there being fewer people or shifts in the population distribution by age since the last census—can lead to implausibly high vaccination percentages and, conversely, a derived count of unvaccinated people that is too low, which would lead to an overestimation of rates in the unvaccinated.\n\n\nAge-adjusted rates\nEven if every record were perfectly matched and every population definition perfectly standardized, inherent differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations still exist. Age is a particularly strong predictor of Covid-19 outcomes, and in general also a predictor of vaccine status. Due to a number of factors like the time at which they became eligible and perceived risk, the vaccinated population overall is likely to be older than the unvaccinated population. Since older people are generally more at risk for worse outcomes than younger people, RR and vaccine effectiveness calculations could be biased toward worse outcomes based solely on the age distribution of the individuals who are vaccinated.\nAlong these lines, we see states report two types of rates:\n\nCrude rates—calculated using the total number of outcomes in the total without adjusting for variations in a factor like age distribution\nAge-adjusted rates—calculated by adjusting the crude rate to reflect the age distribution of a “standard population,” usually the state or federal population as a whole.\n\nStates that use a crude rate risk distorting the effectiveness of vaccines at a given point in time. Switching to an age-adjusted rate as Colorado did in the fall of 2021 can help create a more accurate picture of vaccine effectiveness over time. However, states using age-adjusted rates must choose a dataset to come up with the best estimate of who is currently living in their jurisdiction. This choice alone can introduce discrepancies across states because:\n\nthey may choose different census data sources\nthey may choose sources from different years\nolder data may not accurately reflect the current population in a jurisdiction\n\nOnce the state or public health body selects a data source, they adjust the crude rates as if both the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations had the same age distribution as the standard population to minimize the confounding effect of differences in age structure. A number of states, with varying population data sources, use age-adjusted rates in their assessment of breakthrough data.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Of the 23 states reporting breakthrough rates, some report age-adjusted rates, some report crude rates, some report disaggregated rates by age group, and for some it’s unclear if and how rates are adjusted for differences in age distribution.\n\n\nThe difference in crude versus age-adjusted rates can also be compared in data compiled at a multi-state level by the CDC:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: CDC-compiled data shows weekly case and death rates per 100K by vaccine status with age adjustment compared to without age adjustment (crude rates).\n\n\nAdjusting for different age distributions can make a big difference in reported rates. In the above figure, that effect is especially pronounced in reporting the death rates. The age-adjusted death rate is much higher than the crude rate in the unvaccinated population, while it is lower when age-adjusted in the boosted population. Rates can also be presented broken out by age group to show the relative risk within and across age groups, as the CDC does for cases, deaths, and hospitalizations aggregated across multiple state and local jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: CDC-compiled data shows the relative risk by vaccine status and age group as weekly rate ratios and rates per 100K for cases, hospitalizations, and deaths before and after Omicron became dominant. Hospitalization data source does not provide rates for the 12-17 age group.\n\n\n1\nIn light of these methodological differences, looking at multiple rate data sources and studies in aggregate can inform a more complete understanding of VE. For example, the United Kingdom’s Health Security Agency (UKHSA) evaluates a range of VE studies to provide consensus estimates of VE against different outcomes of Omicron by vaccine product, dose, and time since last dose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4. UKHSA reports expert panel consensus estimates of VE against different Omicron outcomes by mRNA vaccine product and time since completion of primary series or booster dose"

    "text": "Putting it all together\nIf we assume these breakthrough case, hospitalization, and death counts, our numerator, are a reasonable reflection of facts on the ground, the challenge remains to determine the proper population figure to take as** our denominator **(despite unstandardized definitions of vaccinated, unvaccinated, and boosted and differing data sources for overall population).\nIf we assume our numerator and denominator are both reasonable, we now need to understand them across time. A time series of daily or weekly rates provides a more responsive way of seeing how the pandemic is changing and what interventions may be necessary to address it. This requires accounting for the changing composition of who is making up the unvaccinated, vaccinated, and boosted groups over time.\nUsing only crude population rates can make interpretation difficult, as age is a major factor in both who is likely to be vaccinated as well as who is likely to have a poor outcome. Age adjustment can compensate for these variations, and rate ratios broken out by age and vaccination status can show how the risks for different subpopulations vary across time. However, even these age-adjusted figures can be subject to other unexpected biases that require more thorough, comprehensive analysis.\nAn actionable and interpretable measure of risk by vaccination status over time and in real time requires, among other things: standardized definitions and transparent methodologies, the ability to match data across sometimes incompatible data systems, and the funding and dedication to do so. States handle methodology about numerators and denominators (and the figures derived from them) in differing and often unclear ways. This results in a patchwork of unstandardized jurisdictional rates data. This means we have to be comfortable with uncertainty and triangulate across our best data sources to interpret trends in breakthrough data.\nAs new variants emerge in a population with an increasingly complex vaccination landscape, we hope that states and jurisdictions will become more transparent about their methodologies and limitations. A lack of consistency in states’ reporting is one of the reasons our team decided to stop collecting breakthrough data. The federal government could help by providing disaggregated rate breakdowns by jurisdiction in addition to national rates. Looking forward, well-documented, standardized methods will be needed to handle the challenges presented by an evolving virus as it encounters continuously changing levels of immunity in both individuals and populations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "To control the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) called on member states to meet a goal of vaccinating 40% of their population by the end of 2021. As of mid December 2021, over 8.6 billiondoses have been administered globally. Unfortunately, the distribution of vaccines has been far from uniform, with the percentage of populations fully vaccinated ranging from more than 90% to less than 1%. Predictably, those countries on the high end tend to be wealthy nations, while those at the low end tend to be low- and lower-middle income countries. In fact, 73% of all vaccines administered have gone to high- and upper-middle-income countries. Fewer than 20% of African countries are on track to meet the 40% goal, and 6 times as many booster doseshave been administered worldwide as first doses in low income countries. This makes the challenge of reaching the WHO’s next milestone of vaccinating 70% of the populations of all countries by mid-2022 even more daunting. The inequitable distribution of vaccines is not just a practical problem for undervaccinated countries. Beyond being a moral imperative, vaccine equity is a global concern. As long as these inequities persist anywhere in the world, everyone, regardless of where they live or their own vaccination status, will continue in the current state of global crisis.\n\nVaccination rates\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Vaccination rates by population size and country income level. High and upper middle income countries have vaccinated far more of their populations than have most low and lower middle income countries.\n\n\nGlobal inequities in access to Covid-19 vaccines reflect entrenched flaws in current approaches to financing for health, pandemic preparedness, and the vaccine supply chain. Pharmaceutical companies resist technology transfer and waivers of trade-related intellectual property. Vaccine “nationalism” sees high-income countries hoarding doses. Investment in the human resources and infrastructure needed for resilient health systems has lagged for decades. Vaccine hesitancy, often fueled by mis- and disinformation, inhibits vaccine uptake in all countries; yet, in countries reliant on donor funding, it is sometimes erroneously cited as a cause for low coverage, rather than a challenge to be tackled with robust resources and coordinated, well-informed programs.\nWhen low- and lower-middle-income countries lack access to the resources they need for vaccination programs, they are at high risk for Covid-19 surges. Furthermore, the finances and underlying infrastructure to respond effectively to the disease are already severely constrained. Vital resources, like well-staffed and well-equipped intensive care units, oxygen supplies, and personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, are all stretched to their limits. This taxes already-overburdened health systems, diverting staff and stockpiles away from other essential programs, resulting in negative downstream health consequences. Longstanding services for infectious diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV, as well as noncommunicable diseases like cancer and diabetes, have been severely disrupted during Covid-19. Well-established childhood immunization campaigns—one of the defining successes of global health—have suffered, with an estimated 22 million children worldwide missing their first measles vaccine in 2020, the largest drop in 20 years. Fueled by limited access to vaccines and a lack of programs that support uptake, the pandemic in low- and lower-middle income countries can become a vicious cycle. Covid-19 cases surge, straining already overburdened health systems and exacerbating conditions that may allow Covid-19 infections and deaths to increase further.\nWith largely unvaccinated populations, and large numbers of inhabitants living in extreme poverty, low- and middle-income countries are vulnerable to frequent Covid-19 outbreaks and rapid and widespread circulation of virus. This sets the stage for the emergence of viral variants. Variants can also arise in immunocompromised individuals who develop chronic SARS-CoV-2 infections, which may be more likely when they do not receive appropriate treatment because of disruptions in health programs. When variants emerge anywhere, the global risk escalates for all people, regardless of income or geography. Local emergence of variants like Alpha and Delta quickly evolved into a global problem. Omicron may do the same.\nDetection and tracking of variants requires genomic sequencing, that is, determining the genetic code of the entire virus. Sequencing is more complex than diagnostic testing, and requires specialized equipment and trained personnel.** Scientists have estimated that effective genomic surveillance requires sequencing 5% of cases at a minimum and 25-30% of cases for ideal surveillance coverage. Many countries lack the ability to perform that kind of surveillance.** In fact, 41 mostly low- and lower-middle-income countries have not submitted any sequences to GISAID in the past 180 days based on an analysis of GISAID and World Bank data.\n\n\nSequencing capacity\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Countries that have published more than 2000 sequences to GISAID in the last 180 days\n\n\nSequencing capacity varies greatly based on income level, what % of cases are sequenced, how many sequences are shared, and submission latency. Of these, high income countries are alone in the capacity to sequence more than 5% of cases. It is important to note that political constraints and legitimate concerns around the benefits of sharing data may also affect the percentage of cases sequenced, beyond strict capacity limits.]\nVariants emerging in areas lacking both vaccination and genomic surveillance may have the chance to become widespread before they can be detected and contained. The Delta variant, currently the dominant strain worldwide, was first identified in late 2020 in India, but was not recognized as a public health threat until March 2021, in part because India was sequencing less than 1% of positive samples. It is now the dominant variant globally.\nIn sharp contrast to the timeline for identifying Delta, the identification of a new Variant of Concern, dubbed Omicron by the WHO, happened swiftly. This illustrates the importance of effective genomic surveillance and rapid response to potentially significant variants. \nOmicron first came to light when some PCR tests in laboratories in South Africa and Botswana gave an unusual result called S Gene Dropout or S-Gene Target Failure (SGTF). Some PCR test kits are designed to detect parts of three different genes in SARS-CoV-2. The virus samples these labs were testing were missing a part of the spike gene detected by this test, so it gave a negative result on one of the three parts of the test. When these S-gene dropout results were reported, researchers at the Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA) had been investigating an uptick in cases in the Gauteng province of South Africa. They found the same S-gene dropout in nearly all of the Gauteng samples.\nWhile S-gene dropout can act as a proxy, it is not a definitive identification of Omicron. Other variants also possess this spike gene deletion, including the Alpha variant (which has decreased markedly since its April 2021 global peak, but is still circulating—as indicated by submissions to GISAID.) In addition, a sublineage of Omicron has recently been identified that lacks this particular gene deletion, and thus cannot be detected by the S-gene dropout. Sequencing of the entire viral genome is still needed. When the samples that gave the unusual result were sequenced, they showed an exceedingly large number of mutations, many of them known to affect transmissibility and immune evasion. Nearly all of the samples from Gauteng gave similar results. This new variant was different from any variant previously sequenced.\nThe variant, assigned to Pango lineage B.1.1.529, was detected the afternoon of November 23 and at a press briefing 36 hours later, Professor Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) announced the new variant to the world on behalf of NGS-SA. (Professor de Oliveira also identified the Beta variant.) The next day, November 26, the WHO designated it as a Variant of Concern and named it Omicron.\nGiven this early alert, scientists immediately began studying Omicron to determine how the mutations affect the way Omicron spreads, causes disease, and responds to vaccines and treatments. The results of some of these epidemiological and laboratory studies take several weeks to yield definitive results. In the meantime, the publicly shared information and genetic sequences allow researchers and public health officials around the world to rapidly identify Omicron cases, understand the chronology and geography of its spread, and accelerate our global response. While it is too early to know what the ultimate ramifications of Omicron will be with regard to transmissibility, virulence, or immune evasion, as of mid-December 2021, the wave largely attributed to Delta continues to cause a daily average of over 625,000 cases and 7,200 deaths worldwide.\n\n\nOmicron sequences\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Visualizing the timeline of Omicron sequences collected and submitted to GISAID by country, with circle sizes representing number of Omicron samples collected per date, the line spanning from earliest collected sample to latest submitted sequence, color denoting continent, and ordered top-down by earliest date of collection\n\n\nThe excellent work of South African scientists and other contributing researchers shows how effective genomic surveillance can be at identifying and tracking variants and enabling a rapid response. The value of genomic surveillance can be further enhanced by expanding it to underserved populations, both domestically and globally. The swift announcement of Omicron was a benefit to the global community, yet it was met with travel bans against African nations, without comparable bans on other countries with documented Omicron cases. These bans have been criticized by scientists as being ineffective, inhibiting the very transparency that had alerted the world to the variant, and interfering with the ability of researchers to study it. Inequitable application of policies is yet another facet of the global imbalance that fuels pandemics.\nIn spite of these persistent issues, a steady expansion of genomic surveillance capabilities around the world will aid global surveillance efforts. The Africa CDC’s Institute of Pathogen Genomics is playing a crucial role in coordinating and supporting expansion of capabilities and data sharing, and comparable programs have been initiated to improve genomic surveillance in other low- and lower-middle-income regions. The Rockefeller Foundation, through its Pandemic Prevention Institute, is supporting initiatives in India, at the University of Ghana’s West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens, and at the Nigeria-based Africa Centre for Excellence in Genomics of Infectious Disease. The Pandemic Prevention Institute is also supporting the work of The Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation (CERI), a consortium of public health officials, scientists and clinicians associated with the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), Stellenbosch University and the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). Headed by Professor de Oliveira, CERI has the goal of improving genomic surveillance on the African continent. In addition to its own sequencing technology, CERI’s Genomics Africa Fellowship Program is training scientists from countries throughout Africa, who can then support genomic surveillance in their own countries.\nThis expanded capability will help support the ability to track Covid-19 and guide responses in some regions, and additional public and private investment in surveillance initiatives are still needed to provide effective global surveillance. Genomic surveillance alone will not, however, solve the problem of continued spread caused by low vaccination rates and resulting high transmission rates. Scaling up genomic surveillance and swift data sharing depends on countries and communities seeing the benefits of sharing information—including access to the resources needed to respond. The emergence of the Omicron variant has illustrated to the world the need for vaccine equity and global genomic surveillance. Programs that expand sequencing capacity will aid in attaining comprehensive surveillance. Controlling the pandemic depends on using genomic data to track the virus, as well as taking the steps needed to end the inequities that contribute to the emergence of variants that may threaten the globe."

    "text": "The course of the Covid-19 pandemic depends not only on how the SARS-CoV-2 virus changes, but on how communities respond to it. Public health officials can only make decisions to protect their communities if they know how much virus is circulating locally, which viral variants are present, and whether variants are emerging that may be more virulent or transmissible, or less susceptible to vaccines or medications. The only way to do this is through adequate genomic sequencing, which may not be available in communities that need it. Improvements in sequencing technology, training, and lab availability can help overcome barriers to representation and strengthen sequencing capacity and fill in large gaps in genomic data in the US and around the world. Collaboration and trust are crucial for working with communities to track the virus and get ahead of the pandemic.\n\nSequencing detects variants.\nA diagnostic PCR test can tell whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in a sample–but in most cases not which variant. This is because the test detects limited, preselected portions of viral genes. In contrast, whole genome sequencing reveals the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2’s genetic material, also known as its genome. Once a full genome is sequenced, scientists can share data globally and compare it to an array of other genomes collected in global databases such as GISAID. Comparative analysis lets them identify mutations–or changes–from the original (wild type) virus sequenced and shared with the global GISAID community in January 2020. This analysis can spot an accumulation of mutations that could change how a variant virus behaves. Changes like increased transmissibility, an altered clinical course, decreased effectiveness of therapeutic treatments, or vaccine escapemay lead to designation as Variants of Interest (VOI) or Variants of Concern (VOC), which are given Greek letter names by the World Health Organization (WHO). While the Delta variant continues to be the dominant lineage worldwide,the WHO designated the Omicron variant as a new VOC on November 26.\nExtensive laboratory studies can help determine the role of specific mutations, which can help predict the hallmarks of newly identified variants. The table below lists some important mutations in the viral spike protein that have been shown to affect the characteristics of the five WHO-designated VOCs, including Omicron. Mutations in other proteins may also affect the properties of viral variants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Sequencing capacity varies greatly across US states based on what % of cases are sequenced, how many sequences are shared, and submission latency to GISAID over the past 180 days.\n\n\n\n\nGenomic surveillance can help map the pandemic and detect changes.\nGenomic surveillance and other epidemiological studies, such as analysis of air or wastewater samples, can help determine how prevalent particular variants are, locally and globally, and can help track their circulation through populations. Large-scale surveillance is also essential for detecting new variants with different, perhaps more concerning characteristics. Already, scientists have documented multiple sublineagesof the Delta variant, that is, Delta with additional mutations, and one particular sublineage has been designated a Variant Under Investigation by the UK after it showed signs of slowly outcompeting its parent lineage.\nIn unvaccinated populations, rampant viral replication and transmission increases the risk of new variants emerging. Among the vaccinated, patterns of breakthrough cases can provide information about potentially more transmissible or immune-evasive variants. It is thus important to sequence a representative sample of virus obtained from both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.\nIdeally, for effective surveillance, viral genomes from 5% or more of a representative sample of COVID-19 cases should be sequenced. Over the course of the pandemic, only 13 countries have sequenced at that level, increasing slightly to a total of 17 in the most recent 6 months. As of the end of November 2021, the United States ranked 20th in the world (of those sharing at least 5,000 genomes with GISAID) over the course of the pandemic, sequencing around 3.6% of its cases. Over the last 6 months, however, the percentage of cases sequenced and submitted to GISAID by the US has risen to nearly 7%, ranking the US 13th in the world and surpassing the 5% surveillance target. This may be an undercount, since the genomes submitted to GISAID may not represent the entirety of the US sequencing effort. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been collaboratingwith state and local public health departments as well as commercial diagnostic laboratories to increase sequencing capacity in the US. On November 27, 2021, Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, estimated that nationally 5-10% of all diagnostic specimens were being sequenced, meaning the system can detect variants down to 0.01% of circulating viruses. On a state-by-state level, however, the percentage of cases sequenced and shared can vary widely, from 1.1% (Puerto Rico) to 34.8% (Vermont) in the last 180 days.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Sequencing capacity varies greatly across U.S. states based on what % of cases are sequenced, how many sequences are shared, and submission latency to GISAID over the past 180 days.\n\n\nA lack of health services often correlates with housing and food insecurity and other factors that can increase an individual’s risk of SARS CoV-2 exposure and thus community transmission of COVID-19. Communities with limited health care infrastructure may also lack testing and vaccination capacity and the ability to sequence viral samples. High levels of viral transmission or the emergence of variants may or may not occur in these communities, but there is no way to know without adequate genomic surveillance. It is crucial to pair robust testing with variant tracking in all communities, to best protect these areas at risk of high spread. If local outbreaks are identified, interventions such as masking, social distancing, and vaccination can be targeted and decrease the risk of new variants emerging.\n\n\nRecent advances in technology have made sequencing quicker and more affordable.\nThe United Kingdom began using a new PCR genotyping assay in March 2021. This assay uses the same equipment used in diagnostic PCR laboratories while also detecting specific mutations in known variants. The genotyping assay has successfully identified variants circulating in the UK. Although it is inexpensive, at less than $2 per sample, and has a quicker turnaround time than methods that sequence the whole viral genome, the genotyping assay relies on detecting mutations revealed by prior sequencing of whole genomes and cannot detect new variants that do not possess known mutations. This makes it excellent for following trends of known variants in near real time, but inadequate for comprehensive surveillance.\nThe cost for sequencing complete genomes has rapidly declined in the past decade, to as little as $15 per sample. The physical size of the equipment has decreased to the point where some sequencing technology is portable and processing requirements have fallen to the point that data can be processed on alaptop computer. Second-and third-generation sequencing technologies put near real-time, on-site sequencing within reach of more laboratories.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Poorer, more vulnerable, and more rural U.S. counties lag behind in vaccination, including Lincoln Parish, L.A. with 30% in poverty, a medium vulnerability score, and 39% of people fully vaccinated.\n\n\n\n\nObtaining viral sequences from underrepresented populations requires more than just technology,\nas illustrated by a project in hard-hit Louisiana. When Covid-19 cases began a Delta-fueled surge in the summer of 2021, state health officials struggledto get the data they needed. The situation is being improved by a cooperative effort between Louisiana Tech University and Grambling State University in Lincoln Parish, along with the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport (LSUHS) in Caddo Parish. The project is one of four U.S. Regional Accelerators for Genomic Surveillance supported by the Rockefeller Foundation. The aim of the network, which also includes institutions in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, and Florida, is to provide more complete and equitable regional genomic surveillance.\n“What really attracted me to the whole project was the focus on equity,” says Dr. Paul Kim, an Assistant Professor at Grambling, one of 107 historically black colleges and universities in the US. “My role is to try to connect people together so that we can collect specimens that otherwise wouldn’t get sequenced … We’re trying to reach out to the community through people that they know and trust.”\n\n\nGenomic surveillance is made possible through collaboration, outreach, and trust.\nThe Health Hut, a community clinic in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana offers healthcare for its clientele, 65% of whom lack health insurance. The clinic performs a variety of services, including Covid-19 testing and vaccination, and now conducts genomic surveillance. Chelsea Streets, a medical assistant at The Health Hut, helps with obtaining patient swabs for sequencing. “All our patients are very happy to be involved in collecting their samples,” she says. “Anything to help us try to get rid of this Covid.” The process was streamlined by only requiring one swab for both testing and sequencing, eliminating the need for a return visit and making comfort and convenience a priority.\n\n\nEngaging the community also means empowering their clientele with information.\n“I love that people are learning about viruses,” says Dr. Jacquelyn White, Medical Director of The Health Hut. “Everybody knows what an antigen is and what an antibody is.” To increase patient access to healthcare, the clinic has Spanish interpreters, as well as counselors to provide mental health support.\nDr. Kim’s laboratory has recently begun performing the sequencing on-site, rather than sending the samples to LSUHS, and has involved students in the research. Colleagues in Grambling’s School of Social Work have been performing outreach to other community clinics and homeless shelters, further promoting community engagement in genomic surveillance. The project has expanded beyond Lincoln Parish to Webster Parish, and even into Mississippi. A website and data dashboard keep the community informed of sequencing results. The success of the program is evident in the dramatic improvement in genomic surveillance in Lincoln Parish, with the percent of samples sequenced increasing from less than 0.5% to more than 5%.\nCommunity-based programs not only increase vaccine equity but can improve representation of underserved communities in surveillance data and provide a better understanding of the viral landscape to inform public health officials about the state of the pandemic. It also lays the foundation for success with future public health programs.\nKnowledge of the prevalence and characteristics of variants in the environment—especially those that can overcome vaccine-induced immunity—will help public health officials and scientists determine the effectiveness of current vaccines, and help develop new vaccines, if necessary. The need for surveillance will not end with this pandemic, or with coronaviruses. More comprehensive and efficient methods of monitoring other emerging pathogens can help control future outbreaks before they can become widespread. Building upon local infrastructure and generating community engagement will lay the groundwork so communities are not left behind."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In mid-November 2020, as Covid-19 cases were rising and two thousand people were dying every day in the US, Americans needed hope. They got it.\nHope arrived in a syringe. Effective vaccines were developed in record time, with the promise of ending the current pandemic. The scientific discoveries behind that quick vaccine development are also key to halting future pandemics.\nOver the course of two days, Moderna and Pfizer announced the results of their phase 3 vaccine trials. Both vaccines had more than 90% efficacy against symptomatic disease, an efficacy much higher than the minimum standard of 50% set by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Even 75% was considered optimistic by Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The quick development of such highly efficacious vaccines—and the emergency use authorization soon thereafter—led many to predict that the end of the pandemic was in sight.\nGlobally, 36 different vaccines have been approved for use by national regulatory agencies as of May 2022. Yet the pandemic continues, and breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated (and boosted) individuals are increasingly common. There are numerous reasons for the continuation of the pandemic, but attempting to tease out the role of vaccine effectiveness is a complicated matter.\n\nEfficacy and Effectiveness are not the same thing.\nThe original measures of vaccine efficacy were determined by tightly controlled clinical trials. Vaccine effectiveness, on the other hand, is measured in “real life,” in a variety of situations. As the immune status of individuals varies due to vaccination and infection, and as the virus evolves, the picture becomes murkier. Great care must be taken in interpreting vaccine effectiveness from research studies, and even more care is required when inferring vaccine effectiveness from breakthrough infection data reporting systems.\n\n\nCrude estimates of vaccine effectiveness from vaccine breakthrough data can yield unexpected or inaccurate results.\nVaccine effectiveness (VE) measures how much vaccination reduces the rate of Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths in a vaccinated population compared to an unvaccinated population. In theory, converting vaccine breakthrough rates to VE may seem straightforward, but how the rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations have been tracked, calculated, adjusted, and controlled varies widely across different sources and studies. These choices can introduce biases that can have a tangible impact on how a vaccine’s effectiveness is interpreted at a given time. In fact, the practice is strongly discouraged by professional bodies like the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), writing that, even if available,\n\n“This raw data should not be used to estimate vaccine effectiveness as the data does not take into account inherent biases present such as differences in risk, behaviour and testing in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.”\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) provides further guidance on conducting VE evaluations, stating that, while crude VE estimates based on reported vaccine breakthrough data can serve as a rapid screening tool for assessing vaccine performance, especially in monitoring the impact of emerging variants, crude estimates that differ from expectations should trigger more rigorous evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. WHO guidance on conducting VE evaluations using breakthrough case data outlines potential reasons for crude VE estimates to differ from expectation based on clinical trial and observational study results. Differing crude estimates may have valid or invalid reasons that require more rigorous studies to examine.\n\n\n\n\nControlled studies can yield more reliable measurements of VE.\nMore rigorously controlled studies can often account for a wider variety of potential confounding factors. For example, such studies can be designed from the outset to gather more granular data—often to the individual or household level—to help tease the competing strands of explanation apart. Controlled studies use a variety of techniques and analyses to help provide a complementary and overall more complete picture of which factors are driving changes in vaccine performance at a given time. These studies are generally large enough and have data detailed enough to test possible explanations for VE estimates that differ from expected values.\n\nStudies can be designed to separate populations by their time since completing a primary series or booster. This clarifies timing when subjects are transitioning from the broad categories of “fully vaccinated with primary series” to “boosted.”\nStratifying outcomes by time period or variant predominance can more precisely account for differences in vaccine protection due to the ebb and flow of new variants, since VE in the time of Delta can be very different from VE in the time of Omicron.\nThey can look at VE for different vaccine products and dose combinations, since the different doses, molecular compositions, and platforms may have different outcomes, and different populations may have received different vaccines.\nOutcomes such as asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, hospitalization, critical illness, or death can be more precisely defined, measured, and separately assessed.\nAn increasingly complex population immunity landscape comprising those with varying levels of vaccine-induced immunity (from which vaccine products, number of doses, time elapsed since vaccination) as well as infection-induced immunity (prior infection by which variant and how much time has elapsed) can be disentangled.\n\nThe original vaccine trials were randomized controlled trials, where some subjects were given the vaccine and others were given a placebo to determine vaccine efficacy. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has ongoing systems in place to monitor infection in long-term care facilities and Covid-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in the general population, comparing these outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Case studies and clinical observations can be used to highlight initial findings, such as the reports from an early outbreak of the Delta variant in Massachusetts. Information gleaned from these observations cannot reliably estimate vaccine effectiveness because of confounding factors and a lack of controls, but they can be used to inform more carefully controlled studies.\nSeveral kinds of studies can be used to more precisely examine real-life vaccine effectiveness. Household contact studies are designed to determine the level of transmission that occurs from infected individuals to their close contacts (and to see if vaccination affects the level of transmission). Case-control studies (including test-negative designs) can identify similarly matched individuals with and without Covid-19 and compare their vaccination status. Cohort studies can look at individuals with different levels of vaccination and follow those people to see if they go on to experience the designated outcome (such as infection, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, or death).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2. Key vaccine effectiveness studies and monitoring systems used in the US in an interactive list that is sortable and searchable by name, outcome, population, or study design.\n\n\n\n\nControlled studies can also produce misleading results.\nEven within these more rigorous study designs, the devil can be in the details.\n\nSample sizes can be small, particularly when looking at many subgroups or when there has been less time to vaccinate a group (as with younger children most recently becoming eligible for vaccination).\nOutcomes can be rare, which is why data on deaths in younger populations is often too sparse to draw strong conclusions.\nConfidence intervals, which show a range of values that are consistent with the data from a study, can be very wide. They can also overlap, meaning comparison groups may not be significantly different.\n\nBecause of these issues, study findings showing only small differences or wide confidence intervals without a strong evidence base are sometimes treated conservatively with an honest “We don’t know right now.” Any new information, such as the newly emerging trends described above, should be scrutinized closely and compared with other sources. It may be a trend that indicates something real and significant, or might just be a blip on our pandemic data landscape.\n\n\nThere are many things to consider when interpreting VE studies.\nIt may be tempting to read a news headline—or even a tweet—to draw conclusions about what a VE study reports, but it is important to find out more about how the study was conducted. Some characteristics of studies that can affect how they may be interpreted include:\n\nStudy design: Different study designs can have advantages and disadvantages.\nSample size: A small sample size is more likely to show less conclusive and more wide-ranging results.\nSubject characteristics: The age of subjects can have a large effect on VE. Other characteristics might include immunocompromised status, comorbidities, access to testing or healthcare, or behavioral characteristics, such as occupational exposure or level of risk tolerance.\nVaccine product and dose: It is important to note the vaccine manufacturer and type, along with the number of doses and interval between doses. The composition of “vaccinated” and “unvaccinated” populations might be affected by the inclusion of partially vaccinated individuals, or those who received a booster.\nPrior infection: As the number of infections rises, the number of previously infected individuals grows. A prior infection can affect vaccine effectiveness, sometimes acting as an additional dose.\nEndpoint and outcome definition: VE can be measured against an array of outcomes of increasing severity, including: infection (which may be asymptomatic), transmission, symptomatic illness, hospitalization, ICU admission, or death. How these particular outcomes are defined can also lead to clear differences in VE assessments, even against outcomes that could fall in the same broad category.\nReference group definition: VE can also be measured relative to different reference groups for comparison. Most are measuring the benefit of vaccination against a fully unvaccinated group but the value of booster doses could be compared against those who received a primary vaccine series. An even newer example is the evaluation of 4th dose effectiveness compared to primary series plus boosted (totaling 3 mRNA doses) recipients in Israel.\nWhen the study was conducted: The initial vaccine trials performed in 2020, when the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain dominated, yielded different results from newer VE studies performed when the Delta variant was dominant. Those, in turn, will differ from the newest studies against Omicron due to different transmissibility, virulence, and immune evasion properties of these new variants.\nTime since vaccination: Vaccine-induced immunity wanes over time, which is particularly evident with Omicron as the dominant circulating variant.\n\n\n\nThe vaccines remain highly effective.\nNo single study (out of more than 1,000 documented by the WHO) can determine vaccine effectiveness. Systematic reviews of these studies, with a critical eye to the above considerations, offer a more complete assessment of vaccine effectiveness. The best-controlled studies, however, consistently show that boosters significantly improve VE against both symptomatic disease and more severe outcomes, even during Omicron’s predominance.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Summary of US vaccine effectiveness studies estimating 2- and 3-dose mRNA VE over time vs different outcomes in adults during Omicron predominance. VE is higher against more severe outcomes. Receiving a booster increases protection across all outcomes and remains high among immunocompetent individuals 4–6 months after dose.\n\n\nGoing forward, these questions and studies will only become more complicated. Population immunity will continue to wax and wane. More vaccines, with varying targets, will come to market. The number of doses each person has received (and/or infections that person has experienced) will increase. It will then be even more important for data and studies to be presented transparently, with both their strengths and limitations clearly laid out. Individuals will rely on this information to make choices in their everyday lives. Policy makers will rely on it to fashion next steps. Increasing complexity will require more sustained investment in planning and communication."

    "text": "A vaccine breakthrough is defined as a SARS-CoV-2 infection in someone who is fully vaccinated. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) case definition for vaccine breakthrough cases include:\n\nA US resident who has SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected 14 days or more after completing all recommended doses of a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized COVID-19 vaccine\nNo prior SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR or antigen test in the last 45 days\n\nSARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections are extremely rare—documented cases generally occur in less than 0.1% of vaccinated individuals—and tend to cause less severe disease than infections in those who have never been vaccinated. Timely information about these infections is crucial to our understanding of the clinical and epidemiological implications of the breakthrough cases. There are many reasons for vaccine breakthroughs, each of which has important and varying implications:\n\nA weakened immune system in a vaccinated individual (due to age, medical treatment, or a pre-existing condition)\nVaccine degradation (due to improper storage, for example)\nWaning vaccine-induced immunity (studies on the duration of immunity are ongoing)\nA viral variant that can bypass vaccine-induced immunity\n\nThe CDC reported that between January 1 and April 30, 2021, 10,262 breakthrough infections had been voluntarily reported in 46 US states and territories. Of those infections, 27% were in asymptomatic individuals, 10% of infected people were known to be hospitalized and 2% died.\nSequencing and sharing information about viruses associated with breakthrough infections is a public health priority. Doing so can provide an early warning of the emergence of a known or novel virus variant that can bypass immunity conferred by the vaccines currently in use. This is critical to know early to guide public health guidance and to inform scientists of the need to consider modifying the vaccine formulation or to administer a booster dose of existing vaccine. Of the positive vaccine breakthrough infections that were sequenced to date within the United States, 64% were identified as variants of concern.\nSeventeen states currently report vaccine breakthroughs publicly on a regular basis, with varying levels of detail. Ten states report only total numbers and/or the number of vaccine breakthroughs that resulted in hospitalization or death. One state reports vaccine breakthroughs broken down by vaccine manufacturers. Our research into US state reporting of vaccine breakthrough cases can be found here.\n\nIllinois reports only those breakthrough infections resulting in hospitalization or death.\nIdaho and Maine report only the total number of breakthrough infections.\nCalifornia, Delaware, Indiana, Michigan, Tennessee, Utah, and Vermont report the total number of breakthrough infections, as well as the number of breakthrough infections that result in hospitalization or death.\nOklahoma reports the total number of breakthrough infections broken down by vaccine manufacturers, as well as the number that result in hospitalization or death.\n\nIn addition to the number of vaccine breakthroughs, six states report sequencing results identifying viral lineages of the breakthrough infections on their public pages.\n\nNebraska reports the total number of breakthrough cases, and the number of sequenced specimens that represented variants of concern.\nArkansas reports the total number of sequenced specimens that revealed infection with a VOC or VOI, as well as age demographics.\nAlaska reports the total number of patients under investigation for breakthrough infections, the lineages of all specimens successfully sequenced, and the number of breakthrough infections that result in hospitalization or death.\nMontana reports the total number of breakthrough cases, the number of those that result in hospitalization or death, as well as the number and lineages of sequenced specimens that revealed infection with a VOC or VOI.\nOregon reports the total number of breakthrough cases, the number of those that result in hospitalization or death, were symptomatic, and the number and lineages of sequenced specimens that revealed infection with a VOC or VOI. They also report the median age and age range of deaths and the number of vaccine breakthrough cases observed in those who reside in long-term care facilities or other congregate care settings.\nWashington reports the total number of breakthrough cases, the lineage breakdowns of sequenced cases identified as from a VOC or VOI, the number that were symptomatic, hospitalized and died, as well as age, sex and race/ethnicity demographics.\n\nOther US jurisdictions have reported on vaccine breakthroughs just once, on an irregular basis, or only in certain parts of the state, also with varying levels of detail.\n\nConnecticut reported the total number of breakthrough cases, including the number of breakthrough infections that were asymptomatic, and caused hospitalization or death, as well as gender demographics and the number of breakthrough cases that occurred in residents of long term care facilities on May 7, 2021.\nMassachusetts reported the total number of breakthrough cases on May 27, 2021.\nClark County, Nevada reports the total number of breakthrough cases resulting in hospitalizations and deaths, as well as information on vaccine type and age, gender, race/ethnicity, and underlying condition demographics in hospitalized cases.\nColorado reported seven cases of breakthrough cases with the epsilon variant via the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) as of March 2021.\nWest Virginia reported 129 breakthrough cases during a press briefing on April 16, 2021.\nUtah reported the total number of breakthrough cases, as well as the number of breakthrough infections that resulted in hospitalization or death at a press briefing on May 27, 2021.\nNew Mexico reported the total number of breakthrough cases, as well as the number of breakthrough infections that resulted in hospitalization or death at a press briefing on June 2, 2021.\n\nIn many states, public information about vaccine breakthrough cases are only available via media reports, which may be incomplete or even biased. Some states do not make the information public at all.\nThe best approach to controlling the Covid-19 pandemic is through widespread vaccination. The study of vaccine breakthrough infections is one way to ensure that vaccination is, and will continue to be successful. By thoroughly investigating viruses that apparently breach the immunity barrier, we can monitor their prevalence and evaluate potential mechanisms for their occurence. Knowledge of the virus, combined with clinical and demographic information, can be supportive to a better understanding of how the immune status of vaccinated individuals may have contributed to virus evasion of immunity. Linked data to know which vaccine was administered, and when, can further clarify trends that may be associated with specific vaccines to better inform their appropriate use. Importantly, sequencing breakthrough viruses will show if a vaccine-resistant variant virus is circulating or a new variant is emerging.\nThe 10,262 vaccine breakthrough infections reported to the CDC as of April 30 is likely an undercount of the overall number of these cases across the US. As the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention points out, “not all cases are investigated to determine vaccine status and it takes time to validate vaccine status, delaying cases being included in the count.“ It is also reasonable to assume that many more asymptomatic breakthrough infections exist than have been detected, as many vaccinated individuals without symptoms are unlikely to seek testing or medical attention. Routine surveillance for vaccine breakthrough is not common.\nOf the 10,262 vaccine breakthrough cases submitted to the CDC as of April 30, only 555 of the specimens had sequencing data available. There are numerous reasons for such a low number of sequenced samples, including both technical issues and policy decisions.\n\nAs stated by CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, there was not enough virus to successfully sequence “a large portion” of samples from asymptomatic individuals.\nThe quality of RNA in the sample may be inadequate for sequencing.\nLack of coordination between health care facilities, laboratories, and health departments contributes to the low number of samples sequenced. Diagnostic labs that do not do genomic sequencing often discard samples after testing rather than storing them for possible sequencing, for example.\nBecause of lack of coordination, as well as privacy issues, the information needed to thoroughly investigate the causes of vaccine breakthrough is often not connected with samples.\n\nThere can be a significant time lag between the results of diagnostic tests and sequencing.\n\nOn May 1, the CDC transitioned from investigating all reported vaccine breakthrough cases “to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause.” The reasons given were to improve data quality and focus on clinically important infections with an impact on public health. The aforementioned lack of sequenceable RNA in samples suggests that the viral load in asymptomatic breakthrough cases is quite low. “The level of virus is so low, it makes it extremely unlikely, not impossible, but very, very low likelihood that they are going to transmit it,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci.\nThis change in breakthrough reporting policy has drawn criticism from scientists, many of whom argue that every breakthrough infection provides important information. As with infections in unvaccinated individuals, breakthrough infections span the clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to fatally severe. Just as the early pandemic was driven by (untested) asymptomatic infections, some worry that a vaccine-resistant variant could become widespread before it is detected. As more individuals are vaccinated or infected, selective pressure from the immune response may favor the emergence of new variants. Early warning of such an occurrence could be achieved by regular sequencing of a greater number of breakthrough viruses, from the full clinical spectrum, from a diverse population, and in a variety of geographic areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Vaccine breakthrough data reported by the CDC\n\n\nThe policy change has resulted in a dramatic drop in the number of vaccine breakthrough cases reported by the CDC, while the number of reporting jurisdictions increased from 46 to 47. The limitation on the vaccine breakthrough cases the CDC will fully investigate does not, however, prevent states from publicly reporting more information than the CDC requests. Washington, for example, is reporting granular vaccine breakthrough data on a regular basis in two weekly reports. Their SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Breakthrough Surveillance and Case Information Resource includes comprehensive demographic data for cases, a cross tab breakdown on the number of symptomatic and/or hospitalized cases, and the number of deaths among vaccine breakthrough cases. Their SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing and Variants report includes a variant lineage breakdown for vaccine breakthrough cases.\nVaccine breakthrough is a rare occurrence, so every bit of information that can be gleaned from such cases will inform scientists about the epidemiology and evolution of the virus. This information would be much more valuable if it were linked to data regarding the vaccination, the lineage of the virus causing the breakthrough, and clinical and demographic information about the infected individuals. Unfortunately the US health system is ill-suited to connect those dots. States, academic hospitals, and research centers in the US rarely share and aggregate their vaccine breakthrough data, which results in an incomplete picture of the prevalence, spread, and risk associated with emerging variants. This challenge grows exponentially more difficult on a global level.\nCoordination requires cooperation, sharing data, and sharing viral specimens. More data is better than less. More connected data is even better. The COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and the availability, transparency, and management of this information is vital to getting the world through this outbreak. Improvements in our global early warning systems will strengthen our ability to detect outbreaks sooner to reduce the risk of another pandemic."

    "title": "The Critical Challenge of Tracking Breakthrough Infections, and Why We Still Need Better Data Standards",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As the percentage of Americans considered fully vaccinated reached 58 percent, and COVID-19-related deaths surpassed three quarters of a million, concerns over breakthrough infections continue to grow. Breakthrough infections tend to be mild, and the risk of secondary transmission from these infections, while real, especially in high-risk settings, is low compared to those who have not been fully vaccinated. What do breakthrough cases mean in the context of ending this pandemic? The answer is neither simple nor short.\n\nHow are states reporting breakthrough infection data?\nBetween March 2020 and March 2021, The COVID Tracking Project collected data on COVID-19 tests, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths from all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and five US territories. These metrics were inconsistently defined and reported by the 56 jurisdictions. The same seems to be true of the tracking of metrics associated with breakthrough cases, resulting in a similar patchwork of data and creating an incomplete picture of the true incidence of COVID-19 infections in fully vaccinated individuals in the US.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: In the US, states do not report COVID vaccine breakthrough cases, hospitalizations, or deaths in a uniform or standardized manner.\n\n\n\n\nBreakthrough infections are rare, but important to understand.\nUnderstanding breakthrough infections starts with knowing the “incidence” of breakthrough infections. Technically, incidence is the rate, or frequency of a disease in a select period of time. In order to properly calculate incidence, widespread testing–both diagnostic and viral genome sequencing–is critical, as well as the ability to link a positive test to the vaccination status of the individual. Right now, there isn’t a clear or standardized approach to linking these important pieces of information on state or national dashboards. These data would also help illuminate the real-world data of vaccine effectiveness and detect emerging viral variant trends.\n\n\nThe occurrence of breakthrough infections is tied to the dynamics and variability in vaccine uptake.\nOn a county-by-county level the pattern of vaccination in the US is far from uniform. While 9% of counties have rates below 30% of their total population fully vaccinated, only 3% have rates above 70% of their total population fully vaccinated, and vast disparities still remain along economic, racial, and geographic lines.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Vaccination rates visualized on a county-by-county basis show a great deal of variability within regions and states.\n\n\nWithin countries like the US, which have secured enough doses to vaccinate the entire population three times over, accessibility can still be difficult at the individual or local level. As of the beginning of November, more than 21% of US residents over the age of 12 remain unvaccinated. Some say they will eventually get the vaccine, yet as of October 2021, 16% of adult survey respondents said they will “definitely not” get the vaccine, for a variety of reasons. Even among the vaccinated, those with compromised immune systems because of age, disease, genetic conditions, or medical treatments may not generate a robust immune response to the vaccine and may thus be more susceptible to severe consequences from vaccine breakthrough. The safety of these vulnerable individuals depends on the vaccination status of those around them, and the risk of infection rises as transmission rates increase. \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Daily vaccinations in the US peaked in April 2021, then fell, ticking up again in the fall due, in part, to the approval of booster doses for certain populations. Daily COVID-19 cases increased in late summer, after a midsummer lull.\n\n\nBy mid-May 2021, the number of new daily cases was declining and nearly 37% of US residents had been fully vaccinated. On May 13, the US Centers for Disease Control and Infection (CDC) stated that it was safe for fully vaccinated individuals to go without masks indoors, and many state and local governments relaxed their policies on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as indoor mask mandates. Vaccination rates had leveled off. Pandemic-weary individuals, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, began gathering maskless. As a result, localized outbreaks caused pockets of very high transmission rates, concentrated largely in areas with low vaccine uptake. In some areas, the case, hospitalization, and death rates have exceeded those of the January peak.The start of school at the end of the summer exacerbated the problem. The dominance of the highly transmissible Delta variant in these “hot spots” contributed to an increase in the number of infections in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. \n\n\n\nFigure 4: In some states, the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in late summer and fall exceeded those of the January peak.\n\n\nOn a national level, the CDC announced that as of May 1, 2021, it would only investigate breakthrough infections that resulted in hospitalization or death. This change greatly reduced reporting of asymptomatic breakthrough infections, as well as symptomatic infections that were not serious enough to require hospitalization. This change in policy could make it more difficult to detect new virus variants before they become widespread.\nTracking mild or moderate vaccine breakthrough infections can be difficult for a number of reasons:\n\nVaccinated people with mild symptoms may not think they have COVID-19, ascribing their symptoms to allergies, or the common cold, and may never be tested.\nOthers may choose to test at home with an over-the-counter test, the results of which may never be reported, since that data is often literally trashed.\nTesting for asymptomatic breakthrough infections is often conducted for reasons such as requirements for workplaces, schools, or sports teams, hospital admissions, or potential contact with an infected person, and may therefore not be representative of the community at large.\nThe way states and territories report and publish testing, reinfection, and breakthrough data is not standardized.\n\nDespite these difficulties, even less-than-perfect data could provide insights into the state of the pandemic. At the very least, tracking hospitalizations and deaths in fully vaccinated individuals can reveal part of the problem. To date,36 US jurisdictions report breakthrough cases, 34 report breakthrough hospitalizations, and 37 report breakthrough infection related deaths. Unfortunately, not all states report this breakdown of data, for reasons including the inability to match hospitalization and immunization records.\n\n\nBreakthrough tracking is much more useful when clinical and demographic data are also available.\nSome jurisdictions in the US provide good data. The District of Columbia, for example, provides case, hospitalization, and death rates based on vaccination status. In addition, DC provides demographic information for breakthrough cases, including age, gender, race and ethnicity, as well as vaccine type, symptom status, chronology, and whether the case was confirmed or self-reported.\nThe CDC reports cases for 16 jurisdictions and deaths for 15 jurisdictions by vaccination status, vaccine manufacturer. Through COVID-NET, the CDC also reports on hospitalizations by vaccination status for 250 acute-care hospitals in 14 states.\n\n\nWhen testing data can be linked to vaccination data, the result can be powerful.\nFor example, after an outbreak in Barnstable County, Massachusetts in July, the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory and the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University were able to combine testing data with vaccination data and contact tracing to determine that 74% of the 469 cases they studied occurred in fully vaccinated individuals. Of the 133 samples sequenced, 89% were of the highly transmissible Delta variant. Their findings further suggested that fully vaccinated people who were infected could transmit the virus to others. These findings prompted the CDC to change its guidance on July 27 for vaccinated individuals to return to wearing masks indoors in areas where virus transmission was high. Further study showed that, although more than 1,000 people were involved, with evidence of transmission between vaccinated individuals, the outbreak subsided. Control of the outbreak was attributed to the high vaccination rate and a robust public health response involving extensive testing, contact tracing, and reimposition of indoor mask mandates.\n\n\nThe vast majority of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths occur in those who are not fully vaccinated.\nInfections in fully vaccinated individuals are much less common, and tend to be milder. Nevertheless, breakthrough infections can serve as surveillance tools to detect potential new variants or declining vaccine efficacy. Information on vaccinated individuals with breakthrough cases is needed to determine what host or viral factors were involved in the breakthrough. Are breakthrough infections more common in those with certain underlying medical conditions? Is vaccine-induced immunity waning? Was the infecting virus the dominant strain in the area, or perhaps a novel variant?\nAs vaccine rollout for the 28 million children aged 5 to 11 in the US begins, there is hope that total vaccination rates will climb, providing more protection against infection in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Nationally and globally, however, equitable distribution of effective vaccines is needed to bring an end to the pandemic. Careful monitoring of infections in fully vaccinated individuals will help detect potential roadblocks to achieving that goal."

    "title": "Tracking SARS-CoV-2 and its Variants in Wastewater: An Old Technique is Yielding Powerful New Insights in the COVID-19 Pandemic",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The newest addition to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) suite of COVID data trackers reports on levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. While researchers, public health departments, and some private companies have been monitoring wastewater since the beginning of the pandemic, this tracker marks an important step in the establishment of the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS).\nHospitalization and death rates, and case counts obtained from clinical samples, can provide information about the trajectory of the pandemic, but they do not paint a complete picture. Many infected people are asymptomatic or go untested, and the lag time between testing and reporting is often delayed beyond useful purpose. With a long history and a strong scientific basis, wastewater monitoring adds critical data and insights into a rapidly evolving situation. From national systems down to the neighborhood level, or even to individual buildings, data obtained from wastewater can complement clinical data to support evidence-based public health policies and decisions in numerous ways.\n\nWastewater has played a role in disease surveillance for centuries.\nFor thousands of years, humans have recognized that their waste could harbor disease, and sanitation practices were developed to keep sewage separate from drinking water. In a classic 1854 epidemiology example, John Snow used a map of cholera cases in London to track the origin of the outbreak—a pump that supplied water contaminated with sewage. To stop people from using the water, he removed the pump handle. We now know that waste can inform as well as infect. Wastewater testing provides important insights into the health of a population by detecting chemicals, disease-causing organisms, and other markers of public well-being.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A portion of John Snow’s 1854 map of the London Cholera outbreak showing the locations of cholera cases and the source - a contaminated water pump located at the intersection of Broad Street and Cambridge Street (now Lexington Street)\n\n\nFor decades, wastewater testing has played an important role in the global effort to eradicate polio, especially in resource-poor environments. Poliovirus detected in wastewater can alert officials to the presence of the virus in a community, even in the absence of clinical disease. Genetic analysis of pathogen-positive wastewater samples can help track a virus to its source and monitor a virus as it evolves. Control measures, including vaccination, hospital resources, and therapeutics, can then be effectively and efficiently targeted to a specific location.\n\n\nWastewater surveillance is an important part of the public health response to COVID-19.\nUnlike poliovirus and the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which are transmitted through water contaminated with human waste, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the air. Although there is no evidence of COVID-19 transmission through wastewater, about half of infected individuals can excrete the virus in their feces, even when they do not have gastrointestinal symptoms. Viral shedding in feces can occur 3-5 days before symptoms appear, if symptoms appear at all.\nData about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can be used to monitor trends in community transmission and to inform public health decisions. Wastewater surveillance can provide early indications of community transmission or surges in COVID-19, sometimes preceding reports of positive clinical samples by 1-2 weeks, giving health systems critical lead time.** **Declines in wastewater virus levels may also precede drops in clinical cases.\nIn the early months of the pandemic, hundreds of studies demonstrated the feasibility of using wastewater surveillance to track SARS-CoV-2. On a national level, several countries, including Australia, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and Sweden, were able to pivot existing wastewater surveillance programs to COVID-19. Currently, at least 58 countries monitor wastewater at some level. Many of the more than 16,000 water treatment plants within the US are monitoring wastewater, and the CDC tracker is a first step toward a coordinated national system in the US. As more sites come online, and as methods are standardized, the value of the tracker will continue to increase after this promising first step.\nWastewater sampling at a centralized water treatment facility can provide information for a city or region within its sewershed, the area from which wastewater arrives at a single treatment plant. Sampling at smaller sewer catchment areas within the larger sewersheds, such as via manholes, can provide more focused information, sometimes down to the neighborhood level. Any “hot spots” that are detected can then be identified for targeted public health intervention and mitigation.\nOne such “hot spot” was detected in Louisville, Kentucky during the onset of their 2021 Omicron variant surge. The Pandemic Prevention Institute (PPI) partners at the University of Louisville track SARS-CoV-2 in small wastewater catchment areas, which complements the clinical data collected by the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health & Wellness. Prior to Omicron, clinical cases reported within the 40212 ZIP code had been roughly comparable to those of the city, but beginning in November 2021, wastewater data painted a different picture. With wastewater, Louisville was able to zoom in more closely into the community and noted that only part of the 40212 ZIP code was showing unusual patterns of virus prevalence. Specifically, in contrast to the clinical case data, wastewater data showed much higher levels of virus in the Shawnee Park area of 40212, compared to the 34th Street area and to the larger sewershed that includes both Shawnee Park and 34th Street. Such findings suggested a need for localized investigation and potential interventions in the Shawnee Park area, an opportunity that would have been delayed or missed completely by relying on clinical data alone.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ZIP code-level clinical data for 40212, the Louisville, Kentucky ZIP code encompassing the Shawnee Park and 34th Street catchment areas (top), compares case rates in that ZIP code (orange) to those of Jefferson County as a whole (blue). Wastewater data (bottom) shows higher SARS-CoV-2 virus concentrations detected in Shawnee Park wastewater (pink) than in surrounding wastewater catchment areas, including 34th Street (blue), and in the larger Morris Forman Water Quality Treatment Center catchment area (purple)\n\n\nEven more localized data can be obtained by examining wastewater from individual facilities, such as prisons, schools, and long-term-care centers. Samples from airports, aircraft, and cruise ships can reveal infections among travelers. Universities and colleges have used wastewater data from dormitories to detect and control outbreaks. For example, in August 2020, the University of Arizona detected SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from one dormitory. All 311 residents were tested, and two asymptomatic cases were discovered. Those students were isolated, likely averting an outbreak.\nWhen an outbreak is detected in a neighborhood or building, targeted control measures can be initiated. Depending on the circumstances, these might include:\n\npublic health outreach and education\nquarantine or isolation\nclinical screening/testing, vaccination\nsurge staffing for hospitals\ntargeted distribution of stockpiled inventory of therapeutics, ventilators, or oxygen\nincreased masking\nsocial restrictions\n\nThe public health response to such an outbreak can be tailored to the specific population in question, with attention to factors such as language, culture, disability, literacy, mobility, age, and internet access. Mobile testing and vaccination clinics may also be redirected to the area.\n\n\nWastewater testing has been particularly powerful in tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants.\nThe emergence of the Omicron variant in November 2021 has been a turning point in the COVID-19 pandemic. When it was declared a Variant of Concern by the World Health Organization on November 26, 2021, little was known about Omicron’s growth characteristics, transmissibility, immune evasion, ability to cause serious disease, or even its whereabouts. What was known was its genetic sequence. By sharing the sequence rapidly into the global GISAID domain, scientists in South Africa provided researchers and public health officials worldwide the information they needed to detect and track the rapidly spreading variant in clinical samples and in wastewater.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Global prevalence of variants of concern, showing successive waves of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants.\n\n\nGenomic surveillance has been critical for tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants. Reliance on clinical samples for genomic data can be insufficient, however, when healthcare and laboratory systems are limited or overwhelmed. Globally, only 13 countries or territories have sequenced and publicly shared more than 5% of cases with GISAID in the last 90 days. The result is a spotty and geographically skewed picture of variant presence, evolution, and spread. By turning to wastewater, a non-traditional data source that functions independent of medical systems, public health officials and researchers around the world have filled critical gaps in pathogen genomic surveillance.\nAs the Omicron variant spread across the globe, wastewater was often the first indication that it had reached a community. Early evidence of Omicron’s presence in the US was detected in wastewater in California, Colorado, and New York City, as well as in Houston, where the PPI partners with the Houston Health Department. In Kentucky, the PPI partners at the University of Louisville detected Omicron in the wastewater before a confirmed case was reported from a clinical sample in the county. The researchers there were also able to track the rapid change in the dominant variant, from Delta to Omicron, in each of the larger wastewater sewersheds, as well as in the smaller catchment areas within the sewersheds.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Louisville Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 Variant Surveillance: Wastewater testing can identify SARS-CoV-2 variant proportions in wastewater for small catchment areas around Louisville and at larger Water Quality Treatment Centers. This visualization shows the spread of different variants over the past ten months in each wastewater catchment area monitored by the Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, KY INBRE Bioinformatics and Genomics Cores, University of Louisville.\n\n\nAdvances in wastewater testing for COVID-19 can facilitate surveillance for many pathogens, including respiratory pathogens like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Wastewater can also be used to monitor other global threats, like antimicrobial resistant bacteria in disease-causing organisms. With the technology to monitor wastewater in place, communities will be better able to quickly identify and track new disease threats as they surge and wane.\n\n\nStandardization and increased representation can improve the utility of wastewater data.\nWastewater surveillance has come into its own during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of a comprehensive public health strategy, data derived from sewage has proven invaluable in the response to outbreaks, especially where clinical testing is lacking in capacity, access, or representation. It is not, however, a standalone technology, and works best in concert with other clinical and epidemiological studies. Issues still remain to be addressed. Unstandardized sampling and laboratory methods make it difficult to compare data across different municipalities. Globally, many areas lack the physical wastewater and laboratory facilities to conduct this kind of surveillance, as well as the data infrastructure to perform the required analysis. Ethical concerns, including privacy and a history of misuse of wastewater data may require extra care and education to support the implementation of wastewater surveillance systems in different areas.\nAs the full potential of wastewater surveillance for COVID-19 begins to be realized, its advantages are increasingly appreciated by the public health community and the general public. As a leading indicator, it can alert communities to the presence of new variants or an imminent surge in clinical cases. Wastewater monitoring is cost-effective, anonymous, and passive. It is not dependent on access to health care. It provides a more timely, equitable, and representative picture of the level of virus circulating in a community than clinical data, because it encompasses data from individuals who:\n\ncan be symptomatic, asymptomatic or presymptomatic\ncannot access testing\nchoose not to test\ntest at home and do not report their results\n\nThe epidemiological value of wastewater monitoring has been vividly demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of communities that are monitoring wastewater both in the US and worldwide is increasing, though the practice is still more common in high income countries. Accessible data and increased participation of low-and middle-income countries will add additional value. While national programs are vital, local initiatives can provide important information to inform public health decisions. National and international partners can play a vital role in empowering local programs and providing targeted feedback to help assist workers on the ground. This collaboration can help provide rapid, equitable knowledge about the ongoing evolution of a pandemic on a global level. The Pandemic Prevention Institute is working with partners in Ghana, India, and two sites in Bangladesh to enhance wastewater testing in those countries.\nLocal disease surveillance has global impact, since lack of surveillance in one region can result in the emergence and unmonitored spread of viral variants and new pathogens that endanger the rest of the world. Wastewater surveillance will play an increasingly important role in controlling outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, as well as future, as yet unknown, pathogens, thus helping to prevent the next pandemic."
