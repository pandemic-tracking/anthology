## Intro

[The Pandemic Tracking Collective](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/the-rockefeller-foundations-pandemic-prevention-institute-announces-collaboration-with-the-pandemic-tracking-collective/) [is working with The Rockefeller Foundation’s Pandemic Prevention Institute](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/the-rockefeller-foundations-pandemic-prevention-institute-announces-collaboration-with-the-pandemic-tracking-collective/) to survey U.S. vaccine breakthrough infection (BI) data by U.S. states and territories with over 500,000 people. Our scorecard defines and measures best practices for complete and meaningful reporting of Covid-19 vaccine BI data. We assign states letter grades based on their alignment with these best practices. You can read more about why we selected these best practices in [our announcement blog post](posts/20211222-tracking-state-reporting/) and in this [best practices document](#best-practices-guide) we sent to states.

This scorecard does not evaluate how well state health officials are responding to Covid-19 overall, but instead specifically reflects the completeness of each state’s publicly available vaccine breakthrough data reporting and presentation, with a focus on data transparency and interpretability. Additionally, many health departments that do not share BI data publicly face insurmountable technical obstacles to collecting data caused by decades of chronic underfunding. Bear this in mind for states receiving especially low grades.

Our scorecard focuses on the U.S. since states began reporting BI data when global reporting was still scarce; we hope to draw out lessons in best practices that could apply both in the U.S. and globally.

### Scorecard and Criteria
Our state scoring system uses 29 criteria to calculate the grade for each state and territory we track. (We use “state” throughout to refer to states, territories, and the District of Columbia.)

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### _Why is it important to report vaccine breakthrough data?_

First of all, reporting cases, hospitalizations and deaths by vaccination status increases public trust in government response through demonstrating a commitment to transparency. Second, since this data shows the clear trend that COVID-19 hospitalization and deaths are concentrated in unvaccinated individuals, sharing this data can help overcome vaccine hesitancy. Finally, vaccine breakthrough data provides crucial early warning signals for possible changes in transmission or disease dynamics, such as if there are changes to vaccine efficacy from new variants.

#### _Why is it important to report outcomes for boosted individuals in addition to outcomes for individuals who are fully vaccinated who may not have received an additional vaccine dose?_

Protection provided by the primary COVID-19 vaccine series wanes over time. Research indicates that booster doses are more protective against severe outcomes compared to the primary vaccine series alone. This has been especially true during the omicron surge. Reporting outcomes by vaccine booster status allows for a more complete understanding of vaccine performance and any changes in transmission or disease dynamics. Reporting these data may also reduce booster vaccine hesitancy in those who are fully vaccinated but have not received an additional COVID-19 vaccine dose and emphasize that while one or two doses were the dosing schedules studied initially, they may continue to be refined as new data come in.

#### _Why is it important to provide definitions for all metrics reported?_

In the absence of nationally-standardized definitions, states have used an array of reasonable approaches to defining their vaccine breakthrough metrics. These differences mean data between states may not always be completely comparable and clear definitions will allow a data user to understand possible sources of disparity between states. A chronology of changes in metric definitions will also allow a data user to understand when changes in metrics are the result of these underlying definitional changes rather than a change in real-world trends.

#### _Why is it important to publish time series of vaccination breakthroughs and not just cumulative data?_
Time series data illuminate changes over time in vaccine effectiveness and allow for detection of emerging viral variant trends. Cumulative data does not allow for an understanding of trends and, if aggregated into a time series by an external entity, can provide a misleading portrayal due to the effect of reporting delays or data dumps.

#### _Why is it important to publish recent rates and rate ratios of vaccine breakthrough outcomes?_
Recent data illuminate the current state of the pandemic, given evolving immune statuses and fast moving variant trends. Highlighting the most recent data allows individuals and policymakers to make timely and localized decisions about risk tolerance based on relevant data. 

#### _Why is it important to describe the methodology used to calculate vaccine breakthrough incidence?_

Just like with definitions for vaccine breakthrough cases, hospitalizations and deaths, in the absence of federal data standards, states use varying methodologies to calculate vaccine breakthrough incidence. For example, some states report rates per capita over the entire population while others report age-adjusted rates per capita. Clear methodology allows data users to understand the possible reasons for observed differences between rates reported by the states and when rates should not be considered comparable. 

#### _Why is it important to provide raw time series data in addition to rates?_

Because states often use data that is not publicly available, apply tweaks like age-adjusting rates that the public cannot perform, or use complicated methodologies to calculate rates, it is usually impossible for the public to replicate rate calculations unless the state directly provides the data underlying the rate. For the purposes of public trust, transparency, and clarity, it is important to publish raw numbers in addition to rates.

#### _Why should states report these data publicly if they are already reporting it to the CDC?_

The current CDC data does not update frequently and does not include the ability to disaggregate vaccine breakthrough data by state. States have the ability to provide timely and actionable information to the public at a local level, allowing people to make educated decisions based on risks closer to home and on a more timely basis than federal data. States are also more likely to have the most insight into their own data streams and can quickly recognize both emerging trends as well as errors in the underlying data systems. Finally, by gathering and presenting data on local and regional levels in addition to the national trends, resiliency is built into data systems, allowing state data to act as back-ups in the event of a failure of federal data streams.
